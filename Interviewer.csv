Code,Q,interviewer,interviewee
p1,1,Interviewer: So how are you doing?,Interviewee: Im pretty good.
p1,2,Interviewer: Ok well  so please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: ok  uhm  so have you looked at my resume or should I  alright  so I guess ah  I am course 6-7 here at M.I.T  ah which is computational biology  so its a mix of computers  science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology.  Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school  include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer  as well as ah amphibious achievement  which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston  
p1,2,Interviewer: Ok well  so please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So ah  my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care  I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up  and then it came down to the tee and Im like  well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people.
p1,3,Interviewer: So please tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Ok  uhm  one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah  to  run the camp which is over $50 000.00.  Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction  where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm  donations in the form of gift cards  ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates  and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem. I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups  and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan.  
p1,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when your working on a team and faced with a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee:  Ahh  I guess the easiest team project I just I just had  was  last semester  uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture.
p1,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when your working on a team and faced with a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: and we were put in a group of 3 people  and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally  but it ended up being by the end of it  that someone didn't like put there fair share of work in...Ah essentially we talked to him we didn't really get it out  we actually had to go to some of the T.A's we got a little bit ah  and that kinda like pushed him forward  so I mean I guess what I am showing is like  Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself.  
p1,5,Interviewer: Oh yes.  Alright tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,Interviewee:  Uhmmm.  I would say for this job  ah Im a little technically underprepared.  Ah I've yet  I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes  but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles.
p1,6,Interviewer:  Now why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee:  Ah  Im very interested  in the subject of computation biology  and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field  uhm I've had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern.
p10,1,Interviewer: So  how you doing?,Interviewee: Great  how about you?
p10,1,Interviewer: I'm okay.,Interviewee: I'm a little [???] by the resurgence of the hurricane  but..
p10,1,Interviewer: I understand  I got to get home later too and I'm worried.,Interviewee: Yeah  we were half way here and it just turned on a switch  lightening  winds and everything.
p10,1,Interviewer: Oh wow.,Interviewee: So yeah.
p10,2,Interviewer: So  uh  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Okay  um  I'm a Junior here at MIT  um  I'm studying aerospace engineering  um  my  my interests are generally in food mechanics  control  um  design  um  mostly aircraft  but protozoan [???] problems in general. Um  I like to  um  I like to play music  listen to music  um  I run  do some other team sports  I like to play hockey. 
p10,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  okay  so  uh  one of the projects that I've worked on since coming to MIT  um  was during my Freshman year  I worked in the  in the uh  Artificial Intelligence group in  uh  Cesil [sp]  which is a lab  a computer science lab here at MIT.
p10,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: And  um  I was working on a project with another student  actually another Freshman  uh  basically we were tasked with the  sort of  bringing this project  starting this project  bring it up to the level where it could be presented at conference. 
p10,3,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: Um  together  and we were kind of left  to work out the cooperation on our own and um   there was  um  as the conference got closer  about halfway  um  about halfway through the year Freshman year  ah  there were a bunch of issues that we had with um  with um  basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present. Um  and finishing in a timely basis.
p10,3,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: And it came down to whether we were really going to be able to  and there were other basically  parts  other people's work in the same group where work depended on us finishing in time  so it really  um  really  we had to make a decision weather we were just going to basically get done what we could  but to the quality standard that  the standard of quality that was expected of us  or to um  try to finish everything and to have other people's work potentially suffer because of our [??] hadn't really been up to snuff. And  um  and so  we kind of had a little bit of a disagreement about this  but what ended up happening was  um  I went and talked to the professor and um  sort of decided to um  make them aware of what was happening  because they weren't really aware that we had fallen behind. And  um  sort of got the other student on board  who had disagreed with me  uh to do this  uh  and to let everyone else know what was going on  and uh  we ended up presenting a lot less than what was originally expected  but  um  I think it was very much for the better. 
p10,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: Okay  um  so  another  another thing that I spend a lot of my time doing is called  is an organization called Design  Build  Fly here  um  it's  it's a design competition um  run by the IAA  which is an aerospace professional organization.  And um   and uh  you can enter a team from any university or group  basically anywhere in the world. It's mostly US university though.
p10,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: And  um  these university teams basically build a plane  um  design it  build it  fly it as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year  compete against the other universities at the end of the year at one competition. Basically  um  last year we had  uh  a design challenge  it was pretty unique  um  and um  so  I'll take that as our challenge  um  so we basically had a year to solve this  um  and I was head of one of the sub-groups last year  the actual design sub-group  and um  I mean  we approached in a methodical way  just like I think that's the best way to solve most problems. 
p10,4,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: Um  got input from every team member  um  and um  basically  um  looked at  looked at all our possibilities  um   and um we ran the numbers.  Ultimately  like I think that's the best way to solve most problems. We ended up with um  a design that got the best overall score...
p10,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: ...on the basis of just  basically incorporating  um  every team member's input.
p10,5,Interviewer: Mm-hmm. Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,Interviewee: Okay  um  so one of my  I think definitely since coming here  I've noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication. Um  I really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school  but I um  definitely since coming here  I find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills  my written communication skills have atrophied  maybe is the right word. And  um  so I definitely  I think I'm um  pretty aware of this and um  and um.. I would definitely like to improve it and um...
p10,5,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: ...so what I'm going to do is try to force myself whenever I'm writing papers or taking reports for  whether it be for research or for classes  just to go through the proper revision cycle  force myself to make sure that I'm actually being  um  that I'm being succinct in what I'm saying  have other people reading give me feedback.
p10,6,Interviewer: Now why do you think that we should hire you for this position?,Interviewee: Okay  um  I  um  I mean  I think  I don't know what this position that it is...
p10,6,Interviewer: Whatever position you want at a company that you're looking for.,Interviewee: Yeah  sure  but if I knew that this position was  I think that I would want it because um  this is really what I thrive off of. I  um  enjoy doing it  um  and I would be excited to come to work every day to do it. Um  which  um  that's like the biggest thing for me. I um  I would be excited to come do it and I know I would put my  you know  put my all into doing a good job at it  because I would be excited to come do it. And  um  I think that um  I have a decent skill set to do this and I think that I'm qualified to contribute in this area.
p11,2,Interviewer: So  tell me about yourself. ,Interviewee: Uhh  I’m a junior at MIT  uhh I’m double majoring in Management and Biology  er  I’m very interested in the world of finance  uh  business  consulting all of those sorts of things. Um  so I’ve tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh  those sort of roles in the business world. Outside of school  I enjoy running  cross-country and track  I’m on the varsity team at MIT. And umm  I’m also very involved in Greek Life at MIT  so I’m on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming  and also hold a leadership position in my sorority. 
p11,3,Interviewer: Great  okay. Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Umm  so I think this past year  my biggest priority has been my position as Vice President of Programming for Panhellenic and umm  just in that position  uhh  I hold a leadership role on the exec board. We have weekly meetings  I’m charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year. So I have interface with a lot of MIT faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh  to meet and attend different events. And I think to put together all these events I’m working together with different people on campus I have to show leadership and show strong communication skills. 
p11,4,Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge. How did you guys overcome that?,Interviewee: Umm  so I guess this past semester actually  I’m associate advisor for umm  freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor  and er   the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all  er  were very uhh  set on our ideas. So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together . Um  so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first  ‘cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from. But after that  and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be  we eventually figured out what we wanted to do. 
p11,4,Interviewer: Can you be more specific about that  what you eventually figured out?,Interviewee: Uhh  yeah so  we had — we were trying to communicate via email at first  so I think that was  uhh inefficient  especially since we had only met in a group once before  umm so meeting in person and really  trying to outline not just like   what the event was going to be  what our purpose of the event was going to be  and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen. I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event  we were able to build it up from there. 
p11,5,Interviewer: Okay  so can tell me about some of your weakness? Do you have any idea? ,Interviewee: Umm  so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking  actually  and uhh  I think by taking a variety of classes  especially this one class that I’m in  that focuses on management and communication . I’ve been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches  uhh  and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what I’m saying  which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general. I think I’ve been able to build up my confidence and know like  how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better. 
p11,6,Interviewer: Great. So why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Uhh  I think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience  umm would allow me to perform well on the job. I think  I’ve worked umm  both individually in a project as well as in a team-focused environment  which umm  I think is key for consulting and investment banking positions. I also feel that my MIT background  uh  the quantitative analysis that I’ve done in classes  as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well  so…
p12,1,Interviewer: So how are you doing today?,Interviewee: I'm good  how are you?
p12,2,Interviewer: Good. So  why don't you tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Ok  so  I'm a Junior at MIT majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Uh my focus is in uh Robotics and Product Design. Uh I'm originally from Seattle  Washington.
p12,2,Interviewer: Ok. Any extracurriculars  any interests?,Interviewee: Ummm I'm really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology  phased in. So artificial intelligence  or that vein of thinking. Um I'm also  I do a little bit of theater on the side. So  considering doing some sort of combination. It's a wide range of interests so I'm trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but  yeah.
p12,2,Interviewer: Great. ,Interviewee: Mmhmm.
p12,3,Interviewer: Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Yeah  ok. So  um  in high school I was a life guard. And that's  it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a  a team situation. Um  and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi-  like we taught swim lessons. And I would have a partner with me and we'd both be teaching the same kids. And  I'd have to  you know  tell them what to do  or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class. That sort of stuff.
p12,4,Interviewer: Ok great. What about  can you tell me about a time you worked on a team  and you had a conflict or challenge  and how you went about solving that.,Interviewee: Ok ummm  not going to use the lifeguard example again.
p12,4,Interviewer: Can you be more specific?,Interviewee: Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot  ummm I don't know in history class or that kind of a thing  work  working with projects. And sometimes we'd have kids who wouldn't do their home- do  you know their part on time  or people who didn't like they  what they were doing. There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didn't really want to do you know any of the  any of the project  she wasn't really showing up to class  wasn't doing any of the  any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her  and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way.
p12,4,Interviewer: Like  you  you just spoke with her?,Interviewee: In what way? Like -
p12,4,Interviewer: Oh ok  ok. Ok  ok.,Interviewee: Yeah. So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening. And then The next  the next day when the girl came to class we  you know sat her down  asked her why she wasn't doing the homework. Whatever  that kind of stuff. But it was  it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything. So (laughs).
p12,5,Interviewer: Right  ok. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Ok ummm  I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once  and I sometimes put too much on my plate. And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when they've given you too much to do. So I think it's kind of  in terms of how I'm trying to improve that  is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are. And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it  ask for it. And early on  not the day before something has to be done  tell them that it's not going to happen.
p12,6,Interviewer: And last question - why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company  ummm is a great  would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like  like my wide interests  and  and education background.
p13,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Good.
p13,2,Interviewer: Good. So  why don't you tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Ok  umm  I'm currently a junior at M.I.T. studying electrical engineering and computer science. Umm  I first became interested in engineering in high school  I guess  when I worked in a lab at  a material science lab  at U.C. Berkley. Umm  and since then I've worked at a variety of different places including labs and at  uh  and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here  and at Standford  and umm Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley.
p13,3,Interviewer: So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Umm  in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon. I was the principle bassoon there. So  that means I was in charge of the bassoon section. So basically  umm  I ran extra  I ran practices for  within our section outside of  uh   when the orchestra would get together and practice.
p13,3,Interviewer: Mm Hm.,Interviewee: I coordinated that. I also  uh  set up events between the woodwind sections to  uh you know  so people would get to know each other and  you know  we could practice together and things like that.
p13,4,Interviewer: Great. Ok. Tell me about time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Umm  this past summer I worked in Spain. Umm  in operations research and I was part of a research group there. Umm  it was  so  we had  uh  within our team  it was  communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isn't so great and their English wasn't so great.
p13,4,Interviewer: Mm hm.,Interviewee: So  umm  what we ended  we basically communicated through like  the papers  through the papers we read  umm  we  well  one thing that helped was  we both got  like everyone  they got better at speaking English  I got better at understanding them. I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also. So  we were able to communicate by just  you know  talking really slowly  repeating everything a couple times. Umm  we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that. Those were written mostly in English  so that was  that wasn't so much of a problem for me...but...it made it  because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area  looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was  what I was supposed to do. Umm  things like that.
p13,5,Interviewer: Ok  great.  Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you were doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: umm  well  one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and  uh  it becomes a problem because its  it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of  like  the big picture. But since coming to M.I.T. I've been  I've been involved in a lot of classes  a lot of activites and things and that's forced me to manage my time better.  So  now that  uh  like  I have  because I have a lot of time constraints  I'm forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever  and I can't  I can't get caught up in  like  little things that don't ultimately make a big a difference. So  um  by being forced to manage my time more  I'm  uh  overcoming this problem.
p13,6,Interviewer: Great  ok. So  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Well  I have the  I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish  uh  accomplish project goals and get things done. Uh  I can solve problems and  and can work pretty well in a team.
p13,6,Interviewer: Ok,Interviewee: I'm also very interested in what this company does  and  um  I'd really like to work there.
p14,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today,Interviewee: Good  how are you?
p14,2,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: I'm a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but I'm probably gonna graduate this year.  So  uh  that's kind of exciting at scary at the same time.  Uh  like I said I'm a computer science major so some of the stuff that I'm interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff.  I've got a bunch of experience with web development mainly  uh front end development so that's uh  I guess where a lot of my experience lies.  
p14,3,Interviewer: Great.  Tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  so I was  a member of the Society of Women Engineers and with the Graduate Students Association of MIT and the senior class  they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and it's the biggest at MIT.  I was actually the publicity chair for that.  So  it involves you know  interfacing  you know  with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself.  SO  um  it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did I have to become a leader for the Society of Women Engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself.  
p14,4,Interviewer: Great.  Alright.  Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.  How did you overcome that problem.  ,Interviewee:  Well  I...so  for one of my classes  we have to  it's a software design class where you have to work with other students.  So  I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasn't pulling their weight and wasn't contributing in a way that was you know  fair and even  and so what we ended up doing is  we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk.  We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her  it was not playing off her strengths.  So  we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths.  
p14,5,Interviewer: Great.  Okay.  Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. ,Interviewee:  Um  I think one of my weaknesses is I'm a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is.  But what I've done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um  like  say no to a task and just kind of  I guess  modualize [sic] projects more.  So  I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture.  But if I just give myself one part of the project and just  you know  divide it into different modules in my head then I'm able to just  you know  perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail.
p14,6,Interviewer: Okay.  And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Uh  I think that my skill set is pretty unique because I'm both technical and also well-spoken and I'd be able to communicate really well.  And I think it's a unique combination to have both of those skills.
p15,1,Interviewer: Okay so how are you doing today? ,Interviewee: I'm doing fine uh  thank you how about you? Um  have you like you know um  the storm  I hope that hasn't like disturbed any power too much. 
p15,1,Interviewer: No actually it was fine I was expecting it to be a lot worse. I think a lot of people were a lot worse off than I was. ,Interviewee: Oh yeah. I mean Boston didn't get hit too bad so. 
p15,1,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: That's at least very fortunate. 
p15,2,Interviewer: Great so can you tell me about yourself? ,Interviewee: Um  okay so I'm a current junior at MIT. 
p15,2,Interviewer: Okay. ,Interviewee: I'm studying biological engineering. Um  so it's some  some of the things I do on campus. Um  I'm really involved in um  MIT Met Life. So I'm  I'm secretary of the club and I go to the meetings um  and um  part of my roles like help you know organize groups where um  poster sessions and information sessions. Just like spread the word of Met Life on campus um  and that's um  sort of helps me like explore like it has really gotten me more interested in a field of like healthcare. Um  that plus like my um  my studies.
p15,2,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: Um  I'm also involved in Chinese student club escort culture. So I do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um  events like night market which I worked  I helped organize just last week.
p15,2,Interviewer: Oh okay. ,Interviewee: So um  it that sort of helps me with communication  my communication skills. You know talking to the officers of other student clubs. 
p15,3,Interviewer: Great. So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. ,Interviewee: Okay so um  last um  uh  this past summer I worked in a research lab in Bangkok and it was the first time that I had ever been outside of you know the United States for an extended period of time. 
p15,3,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: And one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh  sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing  which was to research um  a generic um  in hopes of releasing it to the market. 
p15,3,Interviewer: Great. ,Interviewee: Um  sometime in the future. Because I had  I was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than I was um  I found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments. 
p15,3,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: Um  it was  it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me. Because she was an incoming graduate student  but she did not have much research like lab experience. So I had to balance like being informative without making it seem like this  like she was in some ways my superior. So that was like an um  I had  I had to like teach her the techniques you know coming off as like oh I know more than you do. 
p15,3,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: Um  but what I found was what worked for both of us was that um I would like explain it to her before we were in the lab which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if like she had to ask me questions like every  like between like every set. So that's um  that's probably the one way I showed leadership. 
p15,4,Interviewer: Great  okay. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge and what you did to solve that problem. ,Interviewee: Okay so the  a couple um  IPs I worked for a start up um  they were a green billing research directory 
p15,4,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: online. And I worked for my fellow exterior on helping to market this  the use of this directory to the clients. Um  so we had to  it was a little bit difficult because we had to like  we had to cold call like people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what it's like to talk to somebody you've never met or seen before and trying to like pitch an idea to them  and be like oh there's this really great resource and you've signed up for it. But we've noticed that you like hadn't used it. 
p15,4,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: Um  are there things that like you feel would make it better. Um  things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective. 
p15,4,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: And um  we both had to sort of like teach ourselves how to talk to like the  the reps that we're calling and we would um  strategize what worked  what didn't  what had people respond and what didn't  and-
p15,4,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: And by like documenting it all down also. So that we could leave like a record of what worked for maybe someone else was to found. So um  eventually we actually got like a system. Like a way we would structure the questions and ask them that word and like list like a couple response. 
p15,5,Interviewer: Great all right. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. ,Interviewee: Okay um  so something so a weakness that I found um  and I'm still like working to try to like overcome it is I tend to be long winded in explaining things. Um  it's hard for me to take something that I'm thinking about and communicating it um  concisely um  the first time around. 
p15,5,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: Because I feel like I always leave something out after I finish saying it. So I tend to go back and elaborate. 
p15,5,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: And then while I'm thinking about it still I'll like talk more about what's coming to mind. 
p15,5,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: Um  it's something that I've been working on by siding it for things like this. 
p15,5,Interviewer: Mm-hm. ,Interviewee: And by trying to take up a more prominent role in like the  in like the clubs I'm in and like trying to you know participate more actively in the classes. Um  trying to as much as I can to go to um  lab presentations for my year off and speaking-
p15,5,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: In front of audiences to try to um  make myself less long winded and more precise. 
p15,6,Interviewer: Alright great and last question. Why do you think we should hire you? ,Interviewee: Um  I think that I can bring I don't know like something  different a new perspective to the table especially coming from MIT. Um  having had like a very quantitative background. 
p15,6,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: Um  and given that I've had like extensive experience um  in research um  and my leadership activities on campus  I think that I can bring both the technical skills and um  a way to effectively  hopefully communicate to um  communicate my ideas and bring like a different sort of perspective to your company. And I'm hardworking um  and I always wanna make sure I will do a good job and detail oriented  and um  I just love working with other people on like projects that excite me. So um  that's something that I come from [inaudible] that flatters me is working with people elaborating. And that's um  definitely a skill that I can bring to your company so thank you for your time. 
p16,1,Interviewer: Great  so how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Very good  how are you?
p16,2,Interviewer: Great  can you tell me a little bit about yourself? ,Interviewee: Yea  um so I am junior here at MIT ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments I am really trying to focus on international development. Ummm and because I am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas. But both focusing on international development. Ummm yea  that’s a little bit. I'm from right outside of Philadelphia  ummm and I am the uh  second youngest of 3.  
p16,3,Interviewer: Great  all right  so can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uh sure  ummm so currently I am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med (sp?). And we actually started last year  but last year it was founded by a different person  ummm although I was part of the like founding board  I guess you would say. Ummm and I guess last year  basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasn't really invested in it. Umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop  we did  we didn't accomplish much last year. So this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces. 
p16,3,Interviewer: That's great.,Interviewee: Yea.
p16,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: umm that is a good question  umm I think  so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?). And it’s a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve. Ummm kind of like a world problem. And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it. Umm and our problem was solving world hunger. So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved. 
p16,5,Interviewer: Great  okay. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Ummm  hmmm  so let's think  so that is a good question. I think sometimes I have trouble working on a project when like  for example when I have too much time right. So umm for example this summer I was working in DC ummm and I felt like when I wasn't given an exact dead line I didn't necessarily like push myself to work to get it done  because it wasn't -- I didn't  have a dead line like I wasn’t sure when I needed it to get done so I was like oh  that’ fine  okay I can do it later. So I think one of my weaknesses I think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline. So I really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself. And trying to stick to those deadlines  and I think it is really hard  I think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines. And I think that is really important skill throughout life. So for example this week I have a lot of things due at the end of the week. So trying to get at least a certain amount done by Tuesday  and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something I have been trying to work on more. 
p16,6,Interviewer: Great  last question - Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Well  we will pretend this is the (inaudible) institute. I am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health  ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area. So recently I actually switched to economics  umm I was originally studying biology  but I felt that I could - that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and I really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect. And I would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to. 
p16,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Doing well. How are you?
p16,2,Interviewer: Good! Alright  so  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  my name is Stephie. Um  I am a junior here at MIT. Um  and  see  I'm currently studying Computer Science  so  um. I'm a six three  um  and  I'm here hoping to  you know  get in touch  and um  see if there's any opportunity for me over at Google.
p16,3,Interviewer: Great! [inaudible] So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  see... Hm  so last semester  um  I took a class in software constructions.
p16,3,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee: So it's six double-o five here. And  um  throughout the semester we had  you know  many individual projects. But  also  two group projects. And  um  something I've noticed very much here at MIT is that people don't like to take initiative and so  um  you know my- we were doing out first group project  and um  you know  my- my partners were pretty cool. But no one seemed to want to arrange a time to meet up and actually get work done.
p16,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: So I jumped in  and you know  shot- shot out a few emails. And made it work.
p16,4,Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: [laugh] How about that? Um  let's talk about that second group project in this class.
p16,4,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee: Unfortunately  my  um  my group members in this  uh  for this project were not quite as awesome as the one before. Um  and  uh  for some reason  um  there were two guys  and  uh  they- they were overriding my code in the repository. So  um  they've completely disregarded any work I've done even after I'd emailed them and told them hey  you know  there are tools to help resolve conflicts in code-
p16,4,Interviewer: Mm-hm,Interviewee: -if we're both working on the same thing. And so eventually  I had to go to the TA and to the professor  went spoke to Ann Hunter. And they helped me resolve the situation. So  you know  sometimes you try your best in the situation and you really-- some things are out of your control. But  um  usually people you can go to.
p16,4,Interviewer: Great. I'm glad that worked out for you.,Interviewee: Thanks.
p16,5,Interviewer: So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: Um  see... I- let's see  I- for the longest time  even when I was small  I've always been pretty quiet. 
p16,5,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: So  um  and back in elementary school even. Uh  on my progress reports they would- they would just say Stephie is- is this sweet girl [laughs] and then  you know  I'd get a mediocre grade for participation  stuff like that. And so that's been an on going struggle for me  um  throughout my life. But  um  people really aren't as scary as  as sometimes I think they- they seem to be  so. It's been going well.
p16,5,Interviewer: Okay  good. What have you been doing specifically? ,Interviewee: Um  see  uh. Well  I've- I've taken classes with  um  with like  speaking components and presentations. Um  so it's  it's a way to get in- my feet into the water. But  um  it's been a good experience  so.
p16,6,Interviewer: Great. Okay  last question. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Hmm  I think that I have a lot to offer. Um  my skill set is  pretty good? Um  you know I've- I've picked up a lot of skills here at MIT and also on my own  um  through research here at MIT.
p16,6,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: And  you know  I think  I can be a valuable asset to  to...
p17,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Good. How are you?
p17,2,Interviewer: Good. So  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  so I'm a junior at MIT. I'm majoring in environmental engineering.
p17,2,Interviewer: Mmhmm,Interviewee: Um  and so I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology  environmental transport. Um  I've done internships previously with environmental restoration companies.
p17,2,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: And I also participated in research last summer.
p17,2,Interviewer: Career goals?,Interviewee: Um  I'd like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again.
p17,3,Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  so this semester I became President of the Women's Independent Living Group.
p17,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: Um  after being House Manager last semester. So I've worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house.
p17,3,Interviewer: Can you be a little bit more specific?,Interviewee: Um  So as house manager  um  I organized work week at the beginning of this year. So it's a time when - there's about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and  um  works on the house  paints rooms  like fixes it up before the school year starts. So I organized that  assigned jobs to people and facilitated that.
p17,4,Interviewer: Okay  great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Um  so I'm also on the rowing team.
p17,4,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: And I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for  but I guess  I was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay  but we weren't performing up to our standards. And so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat. Um  and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semi-finals at Patriot League. So I think it's the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say.
p17,4,Interviewer: So the way you change the attitude was by?,Interviewee: Um  kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down  but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had.
p17,5,Interviewer: Okay. Great. And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Um  one of my weaknesses  I tend to be  I guess  a little more withdrawn sometimes. Um  and that's something I've been working on like I've taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team  um  but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener. 
p17,5,Interviewer: Mmhmm,Interviewee: Um  I think I'm like extremely responsible.
p17,6,Interviewer: Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Um  I have a lot of experience. And this is something that I think will help further my career goals and something I'm really excited about learning about. And so I'll put a lot of effort into this project.
p17,6,Interviewer: Mmhmm,
p17,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p20,1,Interviewer: So how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Um  pretty good. Um   yeah.
p20,2,Interviewer: Good. So tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So  um  my name is Dina Wong. I'm a student at MIT. I'm in my third year. I'm majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um  biologic-um  Computational Biology. Um It's pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year.
p20,2,Interviewer: Oh wow,Interviewee: So yeah  so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes. Um in my free time I like to  um  write for the Tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper. Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that.
p20,2,Interviewer: Great what are your career goals.,Interviewee: So currently I'm looking for an internship for the summer. Um  I actually um  I'm exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate.
p20,3,Interviewer: Great. Ok. So tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Ok. Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech. So a what happens is  um  like um  for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time.
p20,3,Interviewer: mhm,Interviewee: So  um  one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section. So there was a um  the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life. And so um  I negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  I guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  I could  it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um  people like  like the Tech is a newspaper you don’t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey.
p20,4,Interviewer: Ok great. So  tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Hmm  Ah...Um I guess again probably using um  let me see..ok so I guess again on  for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular. Um  I guess um  what happened was um  shit  um I really don’t know how to answer these type of questions sorry.
p20,4,Interviewer: It's ok  take your time.,Interviewee: Um...
p20,4,Interviewer: It doesn't necessarily be extracurricular either.,Interviewee: Um...Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then. So in high school I was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like we're  we're competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that. Um  I guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um  could you not do that?  but eventually what happened was I guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like I mean there's  there's motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened.
p20,5,Interviewer: Ok.  Great. So can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: OK  Um  I would  let me think. One of my  I guess one weakness I have is um  well MIT is full of smart people right. Um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level. So um  I guess what I try  what I try to do is like I  I was  feeling badly  but then I realized. Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere. I've been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good  just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's  to like just apply to things and like don’t  and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right. So make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come.
p20,6,Interviewer: Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Well um  so I've been learning a lot about um  computer science since I was here. I've um  I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline. Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I  and not procrastinate or anything like that. Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um  I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a  I would be able to produce um  good products.
,6,Interviewer: Great,
p21,1,Interviewer: Ready? So how are you doing today?,Interviewee: I'm good. How are you?
p21,2,Interviewer: Good. So  tell me about yourself. ,Interviewee: OK. Um  I'm a junior in aerospace engineering  um  I'm originally from Kansas City  um  and I was born on the East Coast. I'm currently deciding whether or not I want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another aviation-related field. I'm minoring in management. 
p21,3,Interviewer: Great. [pause] So  can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership? ,Interviewee: Uh  so  right now I'm actually quite involved with the Global Poverty Initiative here at MIT  and I'm currently the director of ACTION under GPI  Global Poverty Initiative  so I'm currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad  so that includes projects in Mexico  service projects in Central Mexico...
p21,3,Interviewer: Um-hmm.,Interviewee: ...as well as a project with a domestic..an NGO in India that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers  and training women  and working with employer-employee relationships. Um  most of my work has been on the Mexico project  and I led a team -- I actually have traveled down three times -- and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now  and I oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and English.
p21,3,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee: ...that was really validating.
p21,4,Interviewer: Good. OK. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? ,Interviewee: Um  well  most of the challenges that I've faced with a team have been with my projects in Mexico. 
p21,4,Interviewer: OK.,Interviewee: Um  so  probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members  because when we went there  we had originally thought -- we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and bio-digesters  which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste -- and when we got there  we talked to lots of community members. First of all  they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in  so we first had to earn their trust  and we had to establish that we weren't going to  um  just come in and give them something and leave. This wasn't going to be a hand-out. 
p21,5,Interviewer: Great. OK. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? ,Interviewee: Yeah. Sometimes I can be disorganized. I mean  I think everyone struggles with that a little bit  but the way I try to deal with that...recently I've taken to becoming a list person. [laughs] In order for me to ensure that I get things done -- I always get things done  but  you know  when you leave things for the last minute  sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best. 
p21,6,Interviewer: Great. OK. Last question: Why do you think we should hire you? ,Interviewee: I think I have a diverse skill set  and I have very diverse background working with other cultures  not only in Mexico  but I've had experiences in Europe and in China. I'm bi-racial myself  and I think I have a very unique background  and especially as an engineer who's interested in going into consulting  and I have work experience at Space-X and NASA and  um  other companies. 
p21,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p22,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: I'm doing very well. How are you?
p22,2,Interviewer: Good. So  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: I'm currently a junior at MIT. I'm studying biology. Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine  but I don't know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side  but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that. So  within the broader field but I'm not sure specifically what path yet. 
p22,3,Interviewer: Okay  great. So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Umm  okay. So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip. Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer. 
p22,3,Interviewer: Wow  okay.,Interviewee: And it was the first time I'd ever been  which was very exciting um. And it was a very cool experience 'cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills  but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like  'someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water.'
p22,3,Interviewer: Right  right right right right right.,Interviewee: And  you know  make sure the group's staying together and things like that  um. So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot.
p22,3,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: And I think  you know  in other leadership roles  you know  even in a small group project or something. A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying  'Okay  we were in a tough spot like that before.'
p22,3,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: 'How did we kinda rally the group back together?'. Something like that.
p22,4,Interviewer: Great  okay. And can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge? What did you do to solve that problem?,Interviewee: Umm  sure. So  a time when I was working on a team. So I think  um  this situation arises a lot of times in lab. 
p22,4,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: So I was  um  this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University.
p22,4,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: Um  and it was a pretty small lab. I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab. And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of  'Okay  we don't have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment. Can I borrow this from this lab?' 
p22,4,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: 'Can someone check down the hall  if maybe they have this?' 
p22,4,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done. Um and then it was also interesting 'cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab.
p22,4,Interviewer: Oh  okay.,Interviewee: Um 'cause there were some Israelis that were working there.
p22,4,Interviewer: Mhmm. ,Interviewee: And then one of the PhD students was from Russia  and then two of the post-ocs were from India. Um and so the common language among them was English  but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways.
p22,4,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people
p22,4,Interviewer: Right  right right.,Interviewee: And checking emails and making sure they made sense  and things like that.
p22,5,Interviewer: Okay. Right. So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Sure. Uh  I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side. Especially um like if I'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience. And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like  there's a reason why I'm here.
p22,5,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: And I can add something to the experience  even if it's not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role. Like for example  the lab last summer  I was the only undergraduate working there. And so that kind of brought out that shyer side.
p22,5,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: 'Cause I walked in and  you know  everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields. Um  so just kind of keep  keeping up the reminders that like  'I'm here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab  while at the same time realizing that  you know  I'm not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today. And that's okay.' 
p22,5,Interviewer: Mhmm  mhmm.,Interviewee: 'And  you know  I still need to feel comfortable here; I need to add what I can  and then the rest will fall into place when it does.' And I think just  you know  keeping those reminders coming that I don't have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back  relax; see what I  what I can add to the table without freaking out that it's not enough.
p22,6,Interviewer: Okay  great. And  last question: Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Um  I think for me where I'm  where I am at this point  where I'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route;
p22,6,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: The more time I spend in a hospital setting I think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if it's the one-on-one patient care that I care more about  or if it's the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint?
p22,6,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: Um  and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot. Because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level.
p22,6,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: And someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two.
p22,6,Interviewer: Great  okay.,
p24,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Um. I'm good. How are you?
p24,2,Interviewer: I'm doing well. So  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um. I'm a core 16 here at MIT  which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Um. I'm a junior. Um. And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing  ah  interplanetary rover work. Um. I was. 
p24,2,Interviewer: Mm hmm.,Interviewee: Um. So  that it could be recovered by  um  the people who are using it. Um  and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that.
p24,3,Interviewer: Great. Alright. So can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Um. Yes. I can. Um. When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before  um  there was um  some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it. Um  because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time. Um. So  it was fairly...it takes um  not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height. So we had to find a really good drop location.
p24,3,Interviewer: Mm hmm.,Interviewee: Um. And we were having a lot of trouble with that. And  um  we...we were pursuing some options with working with NASA  um  but it didn't look like they were gonna work out. And I took the initiative  um  and I went and I contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer. Um. 
p24,4,Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team. Um. So  um  when..for the Venus rover  which was the other project that I worked on last summer. Um  we had  um  we basically started just with with nothing. Um  because  um  this  this idea's really like in early design phases. It's not like..there's no Venus rover being built by any team. It's just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover. 
p24,4,Interviewer: Good. And which ended up working better?,Interviewee: The turbine did. Which I was happy about.
p24,5,Interviewer: OK. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Um. Yeah. I am not extremely well organized. Um  so  ahh  yeah. My ...my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines. Um. But I ...um  overcome it just by recognizing something that....recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I don't really pay attention to it. Um  so  I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar. Um. Trying to keep myself on top of things.
p24,6,Interviewer: And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Um. I think you should hire me because  um  I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and I think...I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and  I think that  as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO. Working on interplanetary rovers  I've done that before. Also worked on teams um  to try to accomplish goals. Um  so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position.
p24,,Interviewer: Great.,
p25,1,Interviewer: How are you doing?,Interviewee: I'm doing well thank you.
p25,2,Interviewer: Good. Can you tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Um  I'm currently a junior studying chemistry in biology  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'm primarily interested in biochemistry research  pacifically  how small molecules interact with the body  um  and produce physiological effects. 
p25,2,Interviewer: MmmHmm.,Interviewee: I've done research as an undergraduate  um  in the lab that's chemistry and biological  um  engineering. So I've been able to work at a chemical  biology interface.
p25,3,Interviewer: Great. Okay  so tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership. ,Interviewee: I've demonstrated leadership through my role in dorm's house government.
p25,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: I've been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years. Um  so through that I've been able to work with others  and um  work with the  like  other members of house government as well as the administration. Um  and bring  um  concerns from residents to the administration  and represent them.    
p25,4,Interviewer: Okay. Tell me about a time where you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: I've um  been able to work on teams  um  during my undergraduate classes  we  um  in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work  um  in small groups of two or three. So there's definitely been challenges in those situations where  for example  team member accidentally does something wrong  like  cost us a lot of product  or makes our experiment go wrong  and I found it helpful to kind of  be like  able to put  you know  aside my annoying side when someone's done in the moment  and figure how to move forward.
p25,4,Interviewer: Mmmhmm.,Interviewee: Um  as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently  try to see how to go forward with that. 
p25,5,Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?  ,Interviewee: I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience  because I haven't had a lot of it. Um  I also haven't had much experience working in a team environment  but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this  um  looking for even more of a role in house government this year  um  and actually running for house president. How soon to try to get a leadership position. So I'm trying to more experience in those areas.
p25,6,Interviewer: Great. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I bring experience from  um  from my education at M.I.T.  which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment  to work hard and be able to solve problems  and I've demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that I've already done. 
p25,6,Interviewer: Good.,
p27,1,Interviewer: Um how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Good thanks.
p27,2,Interviewer: tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um I'm a junior at MIT. Um I'm majoring in biological engineering. I play for the women's varsity volleyball team at MIT. Um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at MIT alpha phi. I'm the vice president of the chapter of operations so I'm pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that.
p27,3,Interviewer: Great. Tell me how you've demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um I think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um it's my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working  that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running. We've had like issues with refrigerators. Um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that  that we had to kind of adjust so I think I being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner.
p27,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team.
p27,4,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: Um and we actually get along pretty well so there's not too many conflicts. But I think this is silly as it sounds. One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games. Um and so I think it's kind of nice sometimes I'll just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games. And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what we're gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team. Like what would you like to do after the game? And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that. I'm getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that. So uh I think that way it's just being able to get a couple of different opinions  come to a conclusion before um making a decision. That's been pretty successful.
p27,5,Interviewer: Great. And tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it.,Interviewee: one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time. Sometimes if I'm in a group with a lot of like loud personalities I might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most. I won't um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so I think working to do that and I think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that. I think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on I've been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns.
p27,6,Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I think I have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s. I would have good but also more I feel like I work well with others. I'm able to take initiative and if there's ever some sort of concern I've never had a pro with people coming to me to discuss it. Um I think I'm good at recognizing problems early before they get too uh become a good a big problem. Um and kind of address them in a very professional manner and fix it um the problem can go over smoothly.
p29,1,Interviewer: So  uhh  how are you doing?,Interviewee: Good. You?
p29,1,Interviewer: I’m well. Thanks for coming.,Interviewee: Yeah  sorry  I was- think I was late. I totally  like  messed up. I thought we were at the media lab. But . . .
p29,2,Interviewer: It’s ok. So please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Ahh  hmm. So  uhh  I would- would say that the job I’m interviewing for  let’s stay down here. So  yeay   I’m Chase  and I guess  um  I don’t know. I really enjoy computers and outdoors  that’s -that’s generally what I give people. Um  so in both of these  um  in computers mainly  uhh  at MIT I think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics . . .
p29,2,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . and computational photography as well. So it’s actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems. 
p29,2,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Um  like really deep programming like C  I’m actually getting more interested in. Whereas before when I came to MIT I had no idea about this stuff and I just did a lot of web-development.
p29,2,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  otherwise I just . . . I really just enjoy working on random projects. Going to Aca-thons [SP?] a lot and hanging out with people. Umm  yeah. Just building cool things. Uhh  otherwise  uhh  my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee  which I really enjoy.
p29,3,Interviewer: OK  cool. Uhh  so  uhh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uhh  actually that would probably be . . . I would actually put this on Frisbee.
p29,3,Interviewer: [laughs],Interviewee: Uhh  so I started the Frisbee club in my high school  um  my junior year. 
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: And  umm  basically it was just a bunch of my friends. We used to play around a lot  and we said  “Hey  why don’t we just make this a team?” It was about 15 or 20 of us.
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so I became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week  depending on  like  how people’s schedules were.
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: But it was definitely tricky because  I mean  we had to get  you know  at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game  because you need 7 on each side.
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so  uhh  getting all this organized like everyday was umm  definitely like pretty hard to do. And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play. Umm  and by the end  uhh  we went to a tournament in Texas . . .
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . .which is where I’m from. Umm  and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything.
p29,3,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah.
p29,4,Interviewer: So tell me about a time you were on a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you overcome it?,Interviewee: Uhh  hmm  OK. So let’s- let’s go with robotics. That was one of the classes I was in  uhh  last semester. So  umm  basically  uhh  the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots.
p29,4,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: And figuring out  umm  you know  just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it  doing vision and such. Umm  so finally at the very end of the  umm  uhh  class we had to make our own robots.
p29,4,Interviewer: Hmm.,Interviewee: And so what I did there  umm  basically  uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff. Umm  and I guess  uhh  what I wanted to do was  umm  basically go ahead with everything we’d already done. Uhh  and just push forward with that and just finish off basically. And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom.
p29,4,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so what we ended up doing  I actually took their side  umm  and it worked out very well. Umm  we had  uhh  quite a few tricky problems involved like  umm  uhh  one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly  umm  how the robot can see the world . . .
p29,4,Interviewer: Huh.,Interviewee: . . . and what we had with this  we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with. We had a tile floor and then walls . . .
p29,4,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . everywhere. Umm  so what we were able to do is say  “Let’s just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops.”
p29,4,Interviewer: Huh.,Interviewee: “So let’s look at all the light in the picture and whenever we don’t see any white  that’s actually the bottom of the wall.”
p29,4,Interviewer: Ahh.,Interviewee: Umm  yeah. So then we basically took all these points that existed  that represented roughly the bottom of the wall  and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it  uhh  turned it into a line. Umm  so yeah. That was- that was kind of what it was and it worked really well. In the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and . . .
p29,4,Interviewer: Ohh.,Interviewee: I think the first time they’d actually had  umm  some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning. Umm  actually local- relocalization in the world.
p29,4,Interviewer: Ahh. ,Interviewee: Yeah.
p29,5,Interviewer: So tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it?,Interviewee: OK  uhh  hmm. One of my weaknesses? Umm  I would go with  umm  . . . umm . . .Yeah I should’ve had a better answer for this question . . .umm  I guess . . . I don’t know if I can plan to overcome it. [laughing] I don’t know.
p29,5,Interviewer: You can pick anything.,Interviewee: I- I- I’d actually say  umm  I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams. 
p29,5,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so  I actually really enjoy working in teams in general and that’s  umm  actually been one of my biggest focuses at MIT because I just know everyone is like really great at everything. Umm  but being able to  umm  basically inspire people to do stuff that I think is a good idea. 
p29,5,Interviewer: Hmm. Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Uhh  I have found that I’m not the best at basically.
p29,5,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  uhh  I mean just like  just- just various aspects of just everything. You know  like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know  I’ve got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people don’t agree with me and . . .
p29,5,Interviewer: Hmm.,Interviewee: . . . I either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas.
p29,5,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so  I guess- I guess my plan to overcome this  uhh  so far has basically just been a lot of practice . . .
p29,5,Interviewer: Uhh.,Interviewee: . . . and just doing more  uhh  basically again  like I’ve been doing a lot of teamwork in general. 
p29,5,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: I do really enjoy it. So I think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me  umm  so hopefully I can inspire others.
p29,6,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm. Now why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Umm  [laughs] uhh  I guess because  umm  I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion.
p29,6,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  I- whatever I’m doing  I make sure  umm  to do it with everything that I have and I’m- I’m basically always thinking about the problems that I’m working on. Umm I- I- I generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well  that I always try to narrow it down. I’m not- I can’t take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them. If I’m reading a book  I’m only reading like one or two books.
p29,6,Interviewer: Hmm.,Interviewee: Umm  but with this  umm  I don’t know I- I- I’ve found it so far to be really helpful. Umm  I think my passion generally overflows to other people. Umm  I- I think I’m frequently jumping around  uhh  when I’m doing stuff . . .
p29,6,Interviewer: Hmm.,Interviewee: . . . and like explaining stuff and like listening to people. Umm  so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- I’m always looking at new stuff  learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it  umm  and you know just enjoy making stuff.
p29,6,Interviewer: Mmm-hmm. Well thank you. ‘Preciate your interviewing with us today.,
p3,1,Interviewer: So how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Pretty well.
p3,1,Interviewer: Good!,Interviewee: How are you?
p3,2,Interviewer: Good. Um  tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Um  I'm Nikki. I'm a course 6 major at MIT this year. I live at east campus. Um  what do you want to know?
p3,2,Interviewer: Oh  great!,Interviewee: I'm from Minnesota...
p3,3,Interviewer: Tell me about how a time you've demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Um...um. I was in APO. I was the fellowship vice president for a time.
p3,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: I was responsible for organizing the [xx?]... basically it's limited to three sections.
p3,3,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: Friendship  leadership and service. It was on my [xx?] organizing the events that...helped to foster friendship among the brothers.
p3,4,Interviewer: Great. Okay. So tell about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge? How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: So we had this project a few weeks ago...
p3,4,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: It was a [xx?] of [xx?] and one of our group-mates did the whole thing.
p3,4,Interviewer: Oh  wow!,Interviewee: Yeah.
p3,4,Interviewer: Okay  so...,Interviewee: Um. So we...the other two of us we talked among ourselves to figure out what like had happened exactly  because both of us are just kind of [xx?] really quickly.
p3,4,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: And then arranged a meeting with the TA [xx?]  to see if we could work out a solution and at the end it worked out okay. It wasn't the best  obviously  because we hadn't gotten to do the work.
p3,4,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: Resolved it.
p3,4,Interviewer: Good.,Interviewee: I haven't had this kind of interview in forever....I'm going to ask you to code.
p3,5,Interviewer: Um  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it?,Interviewee: I'm really quiet.
p3,5,Interviewer: Oh  okay.,Interviewee: I just speak really quietly and it's because in my head it sounds louder than I guess it is.
p3,5,Interviewer: Oh  okay.,Interviewee: I work on it. I try to project and all that. I ask people to tell me if I'm being too quiet  cause I can't [xx?]. It's a real problem though.
p3,6,Interviewer: Okay  and last question. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: For what? Uhm  because I learn really quickly.
p3,6,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: Um. I bring a very positive attitude to the job and I like to have fun with what I do.
p3,6,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: And I work hard at it and I don't what to let people down [xx?].
p30,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Good.
p30,1,Interviewer: Good. Ready?,Interviewee: Yep.
p30,2,Interviewer: So  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Uh  well I'm a Junior. I'm an MIT student. Um  I'm majoring in both Math and Computer Science. Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?
p30,2,Interviewer: Oh just like a general idea of what your interests are and like you know what kind of goals you're looking for in terms of the future.,Interviewee: Cool  well I'm really interested in distributed systems actually and that's more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing. Um  I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform. I'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++.
p30,3,Interviewer: Great! So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Well  uh  this was in high school but in high school I was the  uh  president of our robotics team as well as the  uh  in the earlier years the head of  respectively the  the  uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team. Uh  and you know that was a good leadership experience uh  I've also been in  uh  in 6172 we have group projects - they're only two people - but um  in some of the projects I've been the person doing a lot of the organizing. Uh  yeah  um.
p30,4,Interviewer: Okay. So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge? 
p30,4,Interviewer: I mean any situation where you're working with people and there is an issue.,Interviewee: Okay. Well  um  in my 6172 class I'm taking right now I was working with Jason. He is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um  of improvement. And we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold. Yeah  it was pretty intense. And we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code - like  merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on. What ended up happening is that I spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding  him watching - verifying my algorithm. It was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didn't finish this optimization we'd have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster. We ended up getting it not five hundred times faster  but one hundred times faster. I was quite pleased. Working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples' worth of manhours but only n actual hours. Um  and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting.
p30,5,Interviewer: Okay  great. Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Uh  I  when I get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people I'm working with. I think it is not uncommon. Um  but definitely when I'm - especially when I'm tired it's like 4 AM in the morning and I'm working with people. When they're trying to explain something to me or I'm trying to explain something to them there's like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating. It causes me to like  be short with people when like they're trying to explain things to me or I'm explaining things to them. And it's something I'm working on because it doesn't actually make communication more effective  it just makes everyone unhappy. Um. One of - so - there's a couple things one is that like I have to stay up late working on things so I inevitably get practice working at not being snippy. Um  but also like having recognized that this is something that I do  something that is not effective for communication  uh  I have been trying to pay attention to  um  you know  my tone of voice  my friendliness and I've been trying to take the approach that when I do have to try to communicate in these situations  to like  optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication. Because even if I need to be like  working hard and stressing out about the work  the communication portion doesn't need to take up much time. And so if it takes like twice as long  it doesn't matter  because that's not the time you need to optimize.
p30,6,Interviewer: Great! Last question - why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I'm technically qualified  I get along well with people  I am interested in these fields. Like  I'm excited about Computer Science it's like what I want to do. It's a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me. And as a result  I'm going to enjoy work  and enjoy working with people. Um  also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people I'll be interacting with at work. And so  it tends to work out pretty well. In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because I'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people. Bake food  you know. So I  yeah  you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team.
p30,6,Interviewer: Great!,
p31,1,Interviewer: Ready.  So how are you doing today?,Interviewee:  Good  how are you?
p31,2,Interviewer:  Good.  Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee:  So I’m a junior in chemical engineering.  Im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels.  Um and kind of optimizing that industry I think theres a lot of potential there so that’s that’s where my main interest is.
p31,3,Interviewer:  great.  and can you tell me a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee:  yeah.  Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers.  And um we just held in September a career fair banquet.  So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair.  Um and its it’s a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner.  
p31,3,Interviewer:  mmhmm,Interviewee:  so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair.
p31,3,Interviewer:  uh huh,Interviewee:  and and to just give people a chance to talk.  Um and so so I was working with a committee of six people and which I was the leader of and um I think one thing that I I really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on.  Um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when I was one of the team and not leading the
p31,3,Interviewer:  uh huh,Interviewee:  team was it became very disorganized because we didn’t know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing.
p31,3,Interviewer:  Mmm.,Interviewee:  and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well.
p31,3,Interviewer:  right,Interviewee: so in the end it ended up running very well  um  and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome.
p31,4,Interviewer:  great.  Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: um  so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering
p31,4,Interviewer:  uh huh,Interviewee:  um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use. um  and so it’s a very big project
p31,4,Interviewer:  uh huh,Interviewee:  but its very modular.  So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator. Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project.
p31,4,Interviewer:  right,Interviewee:  and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of  slacking off
p31,4,Interviewer:  mmhmm,Interviewee: um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him  had a conversation with him about it  you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project  the deadline is coming.  Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are?  And it turned out that um he wasn’t very um he wasn’t very comfortable writing the code in the program.  
p31,4,Interviewer:  Mmm,Interviewee:  So he didn’t want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute
p31,5,Interviewer:  Great.  Tell me about one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it?,Interviewee:  I think  um kind of within my personality
p31,5,Interviewer:  Uh huh,Interviewee:  I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and  a lot of times I don’t um  realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option.  Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people 
p31,5,Interviewer:  Mmhmm ,Interviewee:  In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldn’t consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out
p31,5,Interviewer:  Uh huh ,Interviewee:  And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best
p31,5,Interviewer:  Uh huh ,Interviewee:  Option in this circumstance.  So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision.  Um and it has worked out really well actually . I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received
p31,5,Interviewer:  Uh huh,Interviewee: But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind.  Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference
p31,5,Interviewer:  Uh huh ,Interviewee:  And talking to the representatives really helped me.  So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons
p31,6,Interviewer:  -great.  And last question.  Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee:  -I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are
p31,6,Interviewer:  Uh huh,Interviewee:  In your job description   but also kind of the enthusiasms. T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the
p31,6,Interviewer:  great,Interviewee:  Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think
p32,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today? ,Interviewee: I'm  uh  pretty good. The weather's nice  uh  outside. 
p32,2,Interviewer: Oh yeah  the weather's great. Um. Talk about yourself.,Interviewee: Okay  so I'm a Junior.
p32,2,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: I'm a Junior at IT. Going to graduate  uh  a semester early  actually. 
p32,2,Interviewer: Oh wow.,Interviewee: So I'm going to be graduating next fall.
p32,2,Interviewer: Oh.,Interviewee: Um. Because uh...I  I've been doing my  my work pretty quickly I guess so I
p32,2,Interviewer: Mmhmm. ,Interviewee: So uh I can graduate early  that's a good thing. Um I'm interested in going into nutrition in the long run. Uh  whether it be through medical school or  you know  even  a certification.
p32,2,Interviewer: Mmhmm.,Interviewee: Whatever  but I uh in the meantime  I want to get into Life Sciences consulting. And I want to um explore the field and and and uh yeah...do it as as soon as I can  pretty  much  as long as I can. In the field. Um being successful. Uh  and getting somewhere. Uh. So. Uh  yeah. 
p32,3,Interviewer: Great! So tell me about how you have demonstrated leadership. ,Interviewee: Okay  so I am President of the Endometrius Society  and last year we organized a networking event so uh that  that comprised of not only students but also  like  working professionals in the Boston area  so basically I got in touch with and invited every single Armenian that I knew  in the Boston area  and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in Bexley hall  so it was also a lot of logistical um  you know  like  practice  getting over uh  getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff. So uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today. So.
p32,3,Interviewer: Good job.,Interviewee: Thank you.
p32,4,Interviewer: So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? ,Interviewee: Okay  so  I'm also involved in MIT Undergraduate research journal  and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year  at the end of each semester  and last spring um we were a little late in our uh  in our uh  timeline  so  it was kind of near finals week  and we still hadn't gotten anything published. So  uh  sorry this was last fall  so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error. So um  we kind of  um  all  you know  pitched in together  and I guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each other's initiative  like in the whole process  and motivation  and motivation  you know  for some people  it's more self-centered  and for others  it's more of a community motivation  you know? And we each had to tap into our individual editors' motivation you know  what kind of people they were  what they were looking for  et cetera  so we had to get people kind of  uh  self started in a way. And uh  yeah  we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh. yeah. yeah. It was a good skill that I picked up  kind of  how to tap into people's sense of initiative and stuff. So. 
p32,4,Interviewer: Definitely.  ,Interviewee: Yeah. Uh.  
p32,5,Interviewer: Great! Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to work on it? ,Interviewee: Yeah. So  uh  one of my weakness I think is  uh  like well  shyness. You know  um um and I may see a little like confident  you know  on the outside  but um I definitely have my moments where I'm like you know  I just  freeze  and I feel like so  you know  like I can't talk to anyone  pretty much  you know  and it's like  it's like maybe ten percent of the time that I'm like that  but uh I kinda want to like get rid of that completely  so  yeah I'm just I'm doing  I'm like putting myself into more like  challenging situations  socially and stuff  to kind of like overcome it. So um  yeah  just  like  you know  taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way  to be social  and stuff  like going to parties  and just being used to being around people  because definitely at MIT you can become  like  socially uh  you know  like  blocked away  so. Yeah. 
p32,6,Interviewer: Okay. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you? ,Interviewee: Um  so I draw upon a lot of leadership experiences  with my enrollment at MIT student groups  um  I've completed three years of MIT without going insane  that's just a joke  but um  um...and I'm very  you know  like  um I'm very organized  I'm a self-starter  I'm  you know  I take initiative  I've organized a lot of events through these student groups  so I'm I'm um  I'm definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized  and you know very  like  having initiative. So yeah.
p33,1,Interviewer: so how are you?,Interviewee: I'm doing pretty well.
p33,2,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: I'm a Junior in course two  [?unknown word?]. I just started going to last semester but I got very interested in product design when I took a class called product design. It was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects. So ours was a toy called Con[?] Control  and my main role is to do a lot of the solid worksing[?] so I make a lot of the CAD 3-D modeling so that we could make the physical components that didn't already exsist. I really enjoyed that because it's kind of an intersection between designing a part and engineering  which I have never really thought of until last year. Outside of classes I try to do a lot of design work as well  maybe in somewhat different fields. Like I work for the Tech as a production editor. So It's a lot of making info graphics and laying out the entire newspaper and making it look really pretty. It's kind of a good break though from equations and things like that.
p33,3,Interviewer: Alright. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee:  I think a very recent example is I am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk  which is ten months of planning  but it took a lot of delegation  a lot of staying on top of things because there's so many components they needed to coordinate. We ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the Boston area. And the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it  so all of them has to participate in some way  whether it's working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics. I personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization. I had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on Google Docs to stay on top of things 
p33,4,Interviewer: Great. And can you tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: If I may  I'll go back to toy product design  'cause I think that was a really good good example. I think all of us--it was a team of three freshmen and two sophomores--none of us had that much experience with product design at all  so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas  different preferences and visions for what we wanted to do  and they clashed a lot in the beginning. It was really difficult for us  like our personalities clashed as well  not just our ideas  which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive  and we just felt like we weren't moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas  prototyping things  and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible  or what was interesting. So we worked through that by just--we worked with our mentors  talking to them as kind of a mediator so it wasn't a completely self-motivated resolution or self--I don't know how to describe it. But it ended up working out  we all kind of slowed down  took a step back  and saw from eachother's perspectives  talked out very explicitly what the plus and minuses of each idea were and what our goals were  given the constraints of the class  being that we had a two hundred dollar budget and just a semester to complete it in. And at this point  like a month left to go. And in the end we just recognized eachother's strengths and we could each take on responsibility for a certain component of the toy  and figure out a way to just meld them all together into the final product. And we did by the end. We had something that we were really proud of. Like a lot of teams ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them  but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project it was very much our own  and we were able to present it on the final day  and that's something that was very rewarding
p33,5,Interviewer: Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: I think one of my weaknesses is my--I forget what it is called. Oh  lack of assertiveness  or lack of confidence in a way. Like I always want to make sure that everyone's ideas are heard  and I feel like lots of times I don't want to create conflict  so I'll kind of back down after a little bit. I'm very open to sharing my ideas  but if there's a lot of criticism then I will back down  and that's something that I'm working on a lot  like just trying to stand behind my own ideas  trying to be more objective about them so I have reasons to resent so that I don't feel like there's any reason for me to need to back down.
p33,6,Interviewer: And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I am very passionate about product design. I feel like it's something that people told me when I started the mechanical engineering lessons  they were like Oh  you just lit up and I can see that you found your passion here. I feel like I'm very detail oriented  so I'm able to create CAD models in a very methodical manner  instead of just drawing random things together. I'm able to think of design for manufacturing overall  and not just what looks nice on paper  but what's actually practicable. I think I am a great team player in that even though I can be passive sometimes  in a way it's good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness  and different levels of confidence  because that way it's not all like  butting heads all the time.  And I think that as I improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people  but also get things done very effectively.   
p33,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p34,1,Interviewer: Yeah  so how are you doing today?,Interviewee: I'm good. How are you?
p34,2,Interviewer: Good. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?,Interviewee: Ok  well i'm a junior at MIT and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Biology. It's a new joint major with a minor in management. So that's a little bit of my background. Um  last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  I was in their principal investing group. So  I was investing in a lot of longer term securities. So  it was like buy side trading.
p34,3,Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Ok  so  my freshman year  um  I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP. It's like a competition where you're supposed to get a team and design your on website. So  it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before. Well  I had a little background but not much. Um  and  basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things. And it's IEP  everyone is trying to have fun also. Then I was like guys we have deadlines. We need to get a B in this. So  basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class.
p34,3,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee: It didn't win any of us awards but at least we finished it.
p34,4,Interviewer: Ok  so  tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: I guess that is kind of related to my previous example. I can talk more in depth about it  I guess.
p34,4,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: Um  so  I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly. Um  which none of us had ever programmed with  like  MySQL or any of those languages before  you know. So  um  I basically tried to delegate tasks. So  I made one of my friends set up the  uh  get hub server and then another friend. I said ok  just try to focus on like the matching algorithms. Then I'll try to put all these things together and create  like  the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah. So that was my team experience.
p34,5,Interviewer: Ok  so that's [pause] Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: I think one of my weaknesses is  um  when I am working on a team sometimes I try to do too much myself. Um  like  sometimes  like  people are  say: oh what can I help you with?  but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past  then I'll try to get it done on my own and not really  like delegate things to them  so yeah. That's something I need to work on I think.
p34,5,Interviewer: And  what are you doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Uh  to overcome it  I am trying to be a better leader. Um  I am actually going through this leadership  uh  program right now. It's called CCLP  so that's been helping me a lot with my leadership skills.
p34,6,Interviewer: Excellent. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience. Um  from my past summers at  uh  Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done. I will work well on a team  but at the end of the day if things aren't getting done  I will over-compensate and do it myself. So  you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm.
p35,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today? ,Interviewee: Huh  pretty well  how are you?
p35,2,Interviewer: Me too. tell me about yourself. ,Interviewee: Um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math. Uh  Obviously I go to MIT  uhm. whoops sorry.
p35,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership,Interviewee: I'm also probably going to major in management science uhm  as well as I'm really interested in minoring in economics. Um outsie of academics I do a lot of sports  I play water polo  I rock clmb a lot  uhm I run and bike a lot and uh I'm involved in lots of random clubs at MIT so I like to keep busy. 
p35,3,Interviewer: Great  can you give me an idea of like  how you...,Interviewee: Uhm well I've been swimming  well I was a varsity swimmer in hs as well as college   uhm  so I swam competitively for 15 years. Uhm  so I was the captain of my high school as well as my summer club swim team. Uhm  leadership wise I guess the summer swim team was where I felt like I had  had the most influential leadership position. Uhm   just because I was on the same team for 14 years. Uhm and so I really got to develop my relationships with all of the younger swimmers  uhm  even before I was in an official captain position
p35,4,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem. ,Interviewee: Oh  um  so I did a lot of uh  uh  coaching of younger kids  uhm  a lot of team management as in like setting up events  setting up meets  heping meets and everything running smoothly  uhm  as well as just leading   you know  cheers  helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices. 
p35,4,Interviewer: Great  and you guys found the problem?,Interviewee: Hm well I was on the financial metrics team  in my internship last summer which was basically just the quantitative analysis team. Uhm  and so we had a problem in one of our like  quantitative analysis programs that was running and non one really knew where it was coming from. So as a team we uh  like divide and conquer  broke down uh individual sections of the program to look at and uh  correlated those with each persons expertise  so I analyzed mainly the R portion whereas um  my teammate  my coworker and lets me lead my sequel portion of the code and broke it up that way  I guess. 
p35,4,Interviewer: Great,Interviewee: Yeah  eventually
p35,5,Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? ,Interviewee: With help from the uh  finance expert
p35,6,Interviewer: And why should we hire you? ,Interviewee: Uhm  Hm. I would say one of my weaknesses is that I don't always push myself hard enough  uhm as far as academically. I like to be challenged but I don't always seek those out. Um  so to overcome that I have done a lot of searching through the MIT coursework to  uhm  find classes that look interesting as well as challenging and to sign up for a lot of classes that are outside just the minimum major requirements so that I could get a bit more of a challenge instead of just doing the bare minimum.
p35,6,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee:  Uhm  because I'm a very fast learner. Um  I'm dedicated and I know how to work hard  because it's something that I've done for my entire life and  uh  I like being busy and I like working hard.  So if I'm given a task I'll work hard until its done well
p37,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doin'?,Interviewee: Pretty good.
p37,2,Interviewer: Mmhmm. So  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Uhh  so I'm a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. 
p37,2,Interviewer: Mmhmm.,Interviewee: Umm  so right now I'm currently in the middle of my junior year. I'm looking for a summer internship company and uhh-
p37,3,Interviewer: Mmhmm. Tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: OK. Umm  so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE. 
p37,3,Interviewer: Mmhmm.,Interviewee: Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine. Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers. Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasn't really able to do much. And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasn't showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who weren't sick uhh and basically help them communicate  talk to each other  and set up meetings. Uhh  I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project.
p37,4,Interviewer: Mmhmm. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a different challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University.
p37,4,Interviewer: Mmhmm.,Interviewee: Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms.
p37,4,Interviewer: Hmm.,Interviewee: So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other. Umm I was working with a partner  but in a larger context of umm a dozen students. Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project  uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design. Umm so that became a bit of an issue  umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed. Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up  up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV. And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there. Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us  the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program.
p37,5,Interviewer: Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.,Interviewee: Ummm  so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late. Umm this is actually probably after I'm used to after I'm used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that  and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed. So  I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what I'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time. It's something that I've tried to implement over the past couple weeks.
p37,6,Interviewer: Now  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Umm I think you should hire me  because umm basically I've demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience  a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company. Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you.
p37,6,Interviewer: Oh  thank-,
p4,1,Interviewer: So  Jay  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  so I'm a junior at MIT. I'm in aerospace engineering. Um  I'm thinking of doing more of the  the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side  although I don't have to decide until later. Um  I'm in ROTC and  you know  in the Air Force portion. I'm hoping to become a pilot. Uh  I applied pretty recently and I'll find out maybe in February or March of next year. Um  I'm also in Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Our house is on the East campus across the river and I've been living there since I was a sophomore. Um  that's  that's basically me.
p4,2,Interviewer: Excellent. So uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  so  probably the biggest chance I got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when I went to pretty much ROTC's version of boot camp. It's called field training and it's about a month long and it's in Alabama. And it's pretty much a test to see what you'd do in really stressful situations. So  uh  they'd give us pretty big things like we'd have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and we'd have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um  I guess the correct action when we get there. And make sure nobody's going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up  uh  we can overcome them. So  being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um  the most challenging leadership experience I've ever had.
p4,3,Interviewer: Hm. That's all very interesting. So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem.,Interviewee: Um  hm  to give I guess a non-ROTC-related example  um  as we have a decent amount of projects in um  Core 16 like Unified is  a lot  is very project based in the second semester and  um  one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um  I guess  the work was being allocated. So at first  it was supposed to be um  very evenly divided so each person on the four-person team would do a quarter of the work. But  um  some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more. And by the middle of the semester  it was very unequal. And so  it was kind of getting  you know  under everyone's skin. So  as a group  after we um  we realized that it just wouldn't  it was really a detriment to our productivity  we all had a group meeting and said  listen  this is what we have to do. We have to reallocate the certain things that are um  are the parts of the project that um  we had  we wanted to originally and um  it just kind of went astray. So  we did that  and we became a lot better.
p4,4,Interviewer: Excellent. So  um  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: Um  working on a team  faced with a challenge. Um  hm. I can think of um  try to not um  hit the same categories. So um  in SAE  in the fraternity that I'm in  last semester I was the recruitment chair. So  the  the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan Rush. Like  plan our events for CPW  plan our events for fall rush  plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year  or for a full school year  excuse me. Um  and  the question was challenges in a group  right?
p4,4,Interviewer: Um  this was  tell me about when you were  tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a challenge. ,Interviewee: Okay.
p4,4,Interviewer: How you solved the problem. So it's challenges and teamwork.,Interviewee: So  challenges and teamwork. So  rush is very team-oriented because you're trying to work with your brothers to um  really see I guess  which freshmen uh  are the most compatible with your fraternity. And that you'd probably have the best time with. So  the way I set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and we'd go out and you know  do fun things and meet freshmen. I would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others. And the team that I was in  uh  was a little bit less active and  of course as being rush chair  I didn't want that to be the case. I wanted to change that. So  um  especially in situations where you don't have um  you don't have like hard  given  not given  but like outlined powers. Like you're not someone's boss. You're just like another brother in the fraternity. Um  the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation. So that's what I ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out. So it was all  always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that you're passionate about it and telling them  or and like having them realize that oh  this is a really good thing that we should be doing. And it will really help us out and it will be fun. So that's how I solved that problem.
p4,5,Interviewer: Uh  very good. So  can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to improve upon it?,Interviewee: So  my greatest weakness. I normally would probably have to think a lot more about. But  I actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in ROTC about a month and a half ago. So  I would say my greatest weakness is when I get put in really stressful situations  I will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and won't necessarily think about  or  I think through the whole process um  like to fruition. I'll kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so  um  so the situation can be like  I guess resolved. So what I'm working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and I know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude. 
p4,6,Interviewer: That's very good. And so  think about a job that you'd like later. Why do you think we should hire you for this position?,Interviewee: Um  I'm a really hard worker. I absolutely will devote myself to um  this company. I  I think as a team member  I'm very cooperative. Uh  if the goal we have as a team  if I agree with it  and for the most part I will. And if I won't then I'll voice  and like I'll voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on. And if I agree on it  um  then I am or I'll definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner. I'll be a very good follower and if  um  if it's needed I can be a very good leader as well.
p4,,Interviewer: Thank you Jay  I appreciate you coming.,Interviewee: All right.
p42,2,Interviewer: So  can you tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Sure  so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science. Uhm  I'm really interested in the intersection of the two. So  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that I'm interested in doing. But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. 
p42,3,Interviewer: Excellent. Let me open my questions up here. So  uhm  can you tell of a time where you demonstrate leadership?,Interviewee: Sure  so  uhm  I guess I'd say earlier this year. So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. Uhm  and  the REX Event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to. So free housing. Uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend. 
p42,4,Interviewer: Wow. So can you tell me about a time where you're working on a team and face a challenge? how did you go about resolving it?,Interviewee: Sure. So I think there's  you know  always been challenges. So last summer when I was at Disney  uhm  there were  there was some disagreement about uh  how we should  when we should schedule  the  uh  what week we should schedule the  uh  trial for. Uhm  and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm  uh  dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues. So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that  you know  by changing this date  pushing it back  we're adding scope to the app and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back. 
p42,4,Interviewer: Ahh  that makes sense.,Interviewee: Yep.
p42,5,Interviewer: Uhm  so  uh  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to over come it. ,Interviewee: Sure. So I think the  the problem  uhm  that I have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people. So  uhm  I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things. So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no. I think let's. you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when I graduate they're able to take on that role. 
p42,6,Interviewer: Mhmm. Uhm. Thanks. So I guess thinking  uhm  about a job that you like to apply for.,Interviewee: Sure.
p42,6,Interviewer: Uh  Why should we hire you for this position?,Interviewee: Sure. I think uhm  I combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise. So  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is  uh  would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates  uhm  have. 
p42,6,Interviewer: Ah  well thank you for coming.,Interviewee: Thank you for having me.
p43,2,Interviewer: Um  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Okay  um  my name's Evan  Evan Muray  I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science. I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky. And  uh  yeah I currently live across the river. I heard about this study through e-mail. So  thought I'd check it out.
p43,2,Interviewer: So  I lived in Louisville.,Interviewee: You did?
p43,2,Interviewer: Yeah.,Interviewee: Nice.
p43,3,Interviewer: Anyway. So can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?,Interviewee: A leader? Uh sure. Um. A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer. Um  and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization. Um  in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them. Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students  so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator  we usually work in tandem. The other activity is dance troop. It's another student organization here at MIT  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  it's a dance show  and I'm a choreography for that organization as well. I lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun.
p43,3,Interviewer: Oh  that's all very excellent.,Interviewee: Thanks.
p43,4,Interviewer: So  can you tell me a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: Sure  uh  I think a great example of that would be this past January  I participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours. It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. We had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening  active listening. I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. And by doing that  um  I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  I mean  we needed to get through it.
p43,5,Interviewer: So tell me one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: My greatest weakness... Hm. Okay. Uh. I'd say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  I'd say  probably uh  self-starting  actually. It's something I've been working  it's like my goal for this year  to work on. In the past I would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes. If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT  is if you have an idea just go for it. It's very easy  especially here  there's resources to do so  and  it's something that I want to work on  I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own. It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects. But  this  I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences.
p43,6,Interviewer: Excellent. So uh think of a job you'd like to get hired for  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Uh  I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to MIT for example  I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science. Many of my past internships  I've been going to  I don't have much experience  but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. I find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  I can get to work on using that sort of technology. In the past couple internships  I've had to deal with new languages  new framework  and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking.
p43,6,Interviewer: Excellent. Thanks again for coming again.,Interviewee: No problem  thank you for having me.
p43,6,Interviewer: Of course!,
p44,1,Interviewer: So how are you?,Interviewee: Pretty good  how are you?
p44,2,Interviewer: Doing well. So can you please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So uh my name's Bonnie. I'm a junior at MIT. I'm in core six which if you don't know is in computer science. I'm minoring in economics umm also mathematics. So I'm interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so  that includes like economics  finance  biology. So a vary wide array of interests. And I'm here today because well I was uh  told it would be a good time here with the behavior study.
p44,2,Interviewer: Excellent. I went to MIT myself.,Interviewee: Oh what year were you?
p44,2,Interviewer: 0-6. ,Interviewee: Okay.
p44,3,Interviewer: Anyway  I'd like to ask you about your leadership experiences. Can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?,Interviewee: Okay  so I'd say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break. A couple friends and I  four of us actually  so a fairly small group  um  we biked from Philadelphia to Boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea. What it actually was  huh  there were some amazing ups  some amazing downs. umm  Definitely a very memorable experience. And there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways  it's raining  and like ??? so we felt like giving up a little bit  just heading back up  taking the train. And I really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60% of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey. Just like I guess evoking everyone's different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome  but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place. And I guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why that's still something that resonates with them. And using that you know I was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here. So that was a very rewarding experience.
p44,4,Interviewer: Excellent. So you can about a time when you were working on a team and faced another challenge  how did you resolve it?,Interviewee: Sorry  a what challenge?
p44,4,Interviewer: Another challenge  just not that particular one.,Interviewee: Oh  oh  another challenge. 
p44,4,Interviewer: Yes.,Interviewee: Okay. Um  well let's see  most of the challenges I've seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges  something that's coming from within the team  or an external challenge. So I guess if we were to talk about an external challenge  umm  something not involving you know lack of motivation  uhh  it would  uh  let's see. So uh  so my  my freshman year I was involved  uh  I was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh  beginning of the school year. And I was  again I was  I was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening  a lot of twelve-hour days to get the logistics down before the event. And I guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people  um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut.
p44,5,Interviewer: Excellent. Can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Um  my greatest weakness I've noticed can be a uh lack of  lack of focus. Especially if I have like a large number of tasks  it's very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time. It's very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things I have to do running in my mind. Um  so of late  I've been trying to basically get more organized. I've you know had this hypothesis that by using a Google calendar  Google this  Google that  all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where I can hash away my uh  my other tasks. It will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that I will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks. Because what usually happens  right  I just write it down on a piece of paper. Um I don't trust that I'll be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is  is pretty great to bear. So that  that's been pretty useful so far. I've noticed that I've had an urge sometimes to think about other things I have to do  but I just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there. You probably knew what you were doing  so don't worry about that. There's a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks.
p44,6,Interviewer: Ah  that makes sense. So uh think about a job you would like to have  why should we hire you for this job?,Interviewee: So I think that one thing um I do retain in addition to well like  like I said I've had what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time. I know lots of people who do focus on one task  it often becomes one task  one project going on for you know a couple months uh becomes the forefront of their thought  their imagination  becomes what they can handle. However  having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past  I think one great skill I can bring to the table is umm provide a very  very agile agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without  with my newfound organizational abilities  getting too uhh too caught up in the mix.
p44,6,Interviewer: Excellent  well thank you again for coming.,Interviewee: Thank you very much for uhh talking to me.
p45,2,Interviewer: I'm well  Thanks for coming. So please tell me about yourself?,Interviewee: Good  How are you doing?
p45,2,Interviewer: Mhmm,Interviewee: Uhh  So my name is Skylar Shieto  I'm a junior currently here at MIT. I'm studying course 18 mathematics  uhmm  currently enjoying it alot  uhmm  classes I'm currently taking not so much.
p45,2,Interviewer: That's good.,Interviewee: Uhmm  I don't know  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
p45,2,Interviewer: Thanks. So  I'm gonna ask you some questions I'd like to ask.,Interviewee: Ok. 
p45,3,Interviewer: So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uhmm  ok  so I was over at Ip I did book reports.
p45,3,Interviewer: Mhmm,Interviewee: Uhmm  I kind of assumed like a project mangerish role  particularly because I wasn't really familiar with Python too much  which is the coding language that they used to test.
p45,3,Interviewer: Mhmm,Interviewee: Uhmm  so I assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing.
p45,4,Interviewer: uh-huh  excellent. So tell me about a time that you were working in a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you go about solving the problem?,Interviewee: Uhmm  Let me see  I usually take this particular example. One of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of  something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesn't have familiarity with that and  especially in a really short time. Uhh  can be extremely difficult. Uhmm  It's how to deal with that. Uhh  sort of just by giving a crash course  uhm  kind of asking other friends to also help  so it's uhmm  kind of give some information and ask for feedback  that sort of thing.
p45,5,Interviewer: Excellent. uhm  so uhh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: ok  uhh  let's see  one of my weaknesses uhhm  technical writing  uhmm  and what I'm doing to overcome that. Actually not very much  I'm taking a math writing class.
p45,5,Interviewer: Ah  interesting.,Interviewee: Uh  so that's been really helpful. It's in a subject that I really enjoy   and I actually have a paper due this Friday so hopefully I show so improvement and that would help.
p45,6,Interviewer: Mhmm  so now thinking of a job that you'd like to have  you got one in mind?,Interviewee: Uhmm  not particularly. Sorry.
p45,6,Interviewer: No? Well just think of something. Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Uhmm  soo  I would like a job which is sort of very open  uhmm  sort of open in a sense that it's open to new ideas  open to uhmm  the ability to uh  work on different stuff. Sort of like whatever you want. Uhm  Also  in like a sense that you can go in and wear whatever you want you don't have to wear a suit and tie everyday  uhm  yeah.
p45,6,Interviewer: So are you thinking of being a mathematician. (laughs),Interviewee: uh  wouldn't be too bad. (laughs)
p45,6,Interviewer: Fair enough  well cool. ,Interviewee: I think this is also the sort of place where I can do things that are in my interest  uhmm  like statistics or computer science.Those sort of things.
p45,6,Interviewer: Ah  excellent. Well thanks for coming in today.,
p47,1,Interviewer:  How are you,Interviewee:  I'm doing well
p47,2,Interviewer:  Excellent.  So  uh  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee:  Uh  I'm a student  I study computer science.  Uh  I'm in my last year so when I graduate in May I'm going to be working on computer science stuff
p47,3,Interviewer:  Mhm.  Now I'm going to ask you a series of questions  um  starting out with tell me a time where you demonstrate leadership,Interviewee:  I demonstrate leadership on the track team  I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh  seniors on the team myself included uh   lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to...to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that.
p47,4,Interviewer:  Tell me a time where you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.  How did you end up solving the problem,Interviewee:  Hm... in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn’t have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group.  So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out.  So that was pretty rough  but this happened like a year ago.  So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices  like there's just no way. And like then it dominoes  which was a huge problem.  
p47,4,Interviewer:  Hm,Interviewee:  And a lot of people suggested a lot of different...a lot of different solutions.  Most of them were like motivated from anger.
p47,4,Interviewer:  Hm,Interviewee:  So uh  some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if I'm if not living there I shouldn’t have to do anything so  so it was like pretty contentious.
p47,4,Interviewer:  mm,Interviewee:  But  but we worked it out to a... it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh  we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room.  So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more  but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh  could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money.  So  so we kept some of the people we kicked out.
p47,4,Interviewer:  Oh good.,Interviewee:  Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed.
p47,5,Interviewer:  Mhm  so uh  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to improve upon it.  ,Interviewee:  Uh  I'm the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized.  My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side.  Um  so  so  it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ?  I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that I've been on that I had to leave  uh  the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like don't just tell you to document just to aggravate you.  So  I worked uh  so like since then like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it.  So that like there’s some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it.  So just to like read my documentation that and which I've never done before until this most recent project had that problem
p47,5,Interviewer:  Well that's always a good practice.  ,Interviewee:  Yeah
p47,6,Interviewer:  So now  thinking about a job that you’d like to have  do you have one in mind?,Interviewee:  Sure  yeah
p47,6,Interviewer:  So now  why should we hire you?,Interviewee:  Mostly because uh  results.  I'm  I just like get things done.  And there’s a like  there's a lot of things I know how to do  especially the job I'm thinking of is like a programming job like a startup.  My background  my degree is actually nuclear engineering.  SO  so like I don't have like the background the internships the stuff like that.  A lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask I don't know  which is pretty rough  but uh I  I think that I would be  I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I'd do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer  being more resourceful  and stuff like that.  So like  I   I feel like I could get more results then somebody who has the same  or somebody who has a better background
p47,6,Interviewer:  Ah  excellent.  Well thanks for coming today.,
p48,2,Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So my name is Fernando Iber  I am a junior here  I come from Puerto Rico  and I am currently studying biological engineering. Uh  I’m considering doing pre-medicine  maybe going into either an MD  and  let’s say  apply to some schools as an MD  or go into an MD-PHD program. Um  my main interest is basically oncology  but  like  I  over the past few years I’m doing a couple of research programs  I did an internship  and it basically  like  gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways. So not just being a clinician  but being a researcher  a medical researcher.
p48,2,Interviewer: Oh  yes.,Interviewee: So that’s how I got interested into the whole MD-PHD thing  and  like  I’ve gotten a hold of some programs that I viewed  and there’s a lot out there. I couldn’t have imagined that if I stayed home. It’s amazing what people do here. 
p48,3,Interviewer: Most definitely. So can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: So I’m  I’m pretty involved in  in campus groups. Uh  I was the first founder of  of their restructuring of Beta Theta Pi  so I’m currently  you would say  chapter president. Uh  so I’m leading the whole  the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus  and we’re getting a lot of results. Um  I’m also in the Board of Puerto Rican students  I serve as social chair  and I am also pretty involved in dorm government  especially rec-CBW planning  so I just like to get around. So any  anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore  any guise is all pretty good for me. Uh  I was also considering something for soccer  uh  in terms of being team treasurer  but unfortunately I had a bit of an accident with my leg  so I got out of soccer. 
p48,4,Interviewer: Sorry to hear that. So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team  and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: So  I actually have a really humbling experience. Last semester I took a class about mechanics. A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore. So everybody there was much more experienced than me  so I was the only sophomore in my group  there were two ones that were juniors  and it was the final project. And when we sat down and started talking about things to do  I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning  ‘cause they already took cell biology  and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics  and they were trying to do some tissue modeling. Like  even though it was a class about mechanics  and I could understand some of the things  I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. And they just put me there  and one of them was really helpful  and actually guided me through the initial process  but the other one was not available at all  at any time. So I basically had to sit down  I actually met with the professor a couple of times  just to  like  talk and chat  and we took the professor out for  for a lunch  so we could just  like  talk about stuff  and I actually had to find out my own way through everything  with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me. And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams  we were all pretty equal  equal minded  or it was in a humanities class. ‘Cause normally technical classes here don’t have much to do with team projects in sophomore year. Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students  so it was a surprise for me where it came  like  I’m a sophomore  and I’m already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics. And it just caught me pretty off guard. And the only way…we ended up doing an extremely awesome project  but it took lots of coffee  Red Bull  and Wikipedia. That’s my strategy for now  ‘cause it was completely new territory right there  compared to humanities or any other classes where you’re  everybody has the same mindset. So that was my group trauma. 
p48,5,Interviewer: So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you’ve done to overcome it. ,Interviewee: So I didn’t have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about  so stemming off of  from the inexperience type of situation  that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened  and I feel like if I get into something that I don’t  basically  know  I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself. So if I don’t come prepared to do something  it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing  which is kind of a handicap  because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me. And I  I  I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter  but it’s hard for me. So I’ve been trying  so basically  like  the solution for me was basically studying more  putting much more effort from my part  but it’s still a big  a big minus in my  in my turf. It’s  uh  it takes me a while to dominate things that  that I don’t have an up-to-speed inclination to that. And that has caused  like  mishaps that  well  through hard work you can overcome them  but a lot of work  compared to your regular person. 
p48,6,Interviewer: Excellent  thank you. Um  so I guess my last question is  thinking of a job that you’d like to have- do you have one in mind?,Interviewee: Yeah.
p48,6,Interviewer: So now  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: So I feel like  even though I’ve gone through many obstacles  I’ve always tried and found a way to excel  exert myself to bigger than I’d previously thought. So I might sometimes feel that I don’t have that knowledge on me  but I will go out and get it  even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort  because there’s also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can  but seeing that actually succeed. You know what I mean? It’s  uh  it’s like what MIT does to you  you’re humbled by an immense amount of work  you’re humbled by  by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces  homework  and exams that you are overwhelmed. But you sit down  you think about stuff. I sit down and I think about stuff  and I get a plan there. That  the good thing about the plan  it takes some time to devise a plan  because it  it’s not as efficient  it’s not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do  but  but  having  like an educated guess  you remember the SAT’s  where it’s like “you may not always know the answer  but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be.” So that’s how I approach things when I have no idea what I’m doing  but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say “hey  I’m here  let’s get crackin’.” Um  that’s sort of  like  the general mindset I have for many problems  be it the life sciences  you have to do an essay  if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells  or if I go by  the walks of life can take you anywhere  if I end up being a consultant for a  for Johnson and Johnson  let's say  a company for random purposes  and  it's the same way you tackle every problem. You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing  then you sit down and do it. Uh  sometimes it's frustrating  because results don't come out like this  um  but I feel like once you get the hang of it  you can start  your productivity increases by x-fold  x be a number  much higher than one  let's talk MIT here. Yeah  I feel that's the  that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot  and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it  so I feel it's the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me. 
p48,6,Interviewer: Oh  well thank you. I appreciate your coming today.,
p48,2,Interviewer: So please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Myself  um  I'm a junior majoring in computer science at MIT I'm very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses.  I want to pursue (?) everyone.
p48,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: A time when I demonstrated leadership was  um  I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip.  And  um  some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially.  And by  um  by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people  what was going on in people's lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time  we were able to have a successful trip.
p48,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve the problem.,Interviewee: Um  a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur? Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem.  And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didn't deny anyone's idea off the bat  we just tried to be as creative as we could be.  And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem.
p48,5,Interviewer: Tell me about one of your weaknesses.  What do you plan to do to overcome it?,Interviewee:  One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion.  But it's  I find it's a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible.  So fail fast  essentially.  That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project. 
p48,6,Interviewer: Now  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Why I think you should hire me.  I think you should hire me because I'm very  I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work.  I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.
p48,,Interviewer: Well  thank you.,
p49,2,Interviewer: So please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: myself umm I don’t know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young. I am Junior right now. I am in my third year. I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics. I am also doubling in core six computer science. and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature. grew up in the states in northern virginia. Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess. I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer. and um other forms of
p49,3,Interviewer: excellent. so tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: umm at high school I was at my junior and senior years I was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something. people thinks of chess as an individual sport. but umm we participated in quite a few team events. through the states which means one every year. which we have been winning every year every year. umm and also at the nationals. and before I went there they were little bit out of leadership. They used to get may be fifth or so. but when I was there I was umm managed to lead us to almost the first. We came in second in three years in a row. We came first in blitz which is speed chess. under my leadership. and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with. but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldn’t have done as well
p49,4,Interviewer: Tell me a time when you worked in a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school. umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school. We were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project. Four persons in the group. and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly. and he was not available. he was out of town at the time. again we didn’t fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error. clearly he had done something incorrectly. So we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint. We had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation
p49,4,Interviewer: Interesting,Interviewee: of course it’s not a life threatening challenge
p49,5,Interviewer: So can you tell me one of your weaknesses? and what are you doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that. Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing. but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks. this is important because where I went to high school. The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing. which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open. but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that. and in the end you probably go to pick something. I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that. umm what I am trying to do to address that. it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical. but what I’ve been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I can’t use the excuse. there are bunch of things I don’t know yet. I’ll keep my options open. I’ll try them out and if I don’t like them I’ll drop. that’s a way to decide what’s left to do that I’d like.
p49,6,Interviewer: Now think about a job that you would like to have. Why should we hire you?,Interviewee: alright so it’s still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance. and umm I think I’d be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work I’ve done physics as well. and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports. I have always known. especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc. trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game. and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job.
p5,1,Interviewer: How are you?,Interviewee: Fine
p5,2,Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Uh  I’m Daniel. I’m a Freshman.
p5,2,Interviewer: Hm,Interviewee: I’m from  uh  Fort Lauderdale  Florida. Thinking about course AN61 here. I  uh  actually  uh  I was here for running  but I realized it wasn’t me  so  um  I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon. So  um  yeah  classes I am doing fine. Looking for a job now. That’s about it.
p5,3,Interviewer:  Excellent. So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uh  I’d say  probably  I’d say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration. I was  um  senior in my  in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing? I’d really  like  thought it showed them that  like  even though I wasn’t put in the best situation  like  I performed indiscriminately. And  I think  in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even  like  half the season we were always like around the same time. And  we ended up  uh  medaling at states. And I’d say that  um  a good part of that is by leading by example by the older  um  upper classmen  so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership.
p5,4,Interviewer: Excellent. So  it sounds like you have worked on a lot of teams. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?,Interviewee: Well  there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing. So um  if it wasn’t  I think  um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year  and she helped me sort things a lot. She showed that I did have  um  proper technique. It was more of like  like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better. I realized that  um  as long as I kept on pursuing the sport  like  that’s all that really mattered. That’s all  like  my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere  that will help me get into MIT. So  I feel like  um  this  this like seeing things in my own way  right  and being distraught by other people effecting me helped. 
p5,5,Interviewer: Ah  that’s  uh  very good. So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you’ve done to overcome it.,Interviewee: I think one of my weaknesses has to be  um  the fact that  I’m a little  um  delinquent with my work. And  uh  um  I’m lazy at times. I definitely procrastinate. It was a pursuing thing through high school. And  uh  it’s still a little now because of a passing record. One of my combating is goal setting. I learned it from one of my  uh  from one of these  one of an upperclassmen that I know in  uh  at MIT. He  uh  told me  like  to write out  like  weekly goals and write out long term goals. Like  long terms goals meaning  like  the end of MIT  after MIT  what you want to do after the MIT experience  and short term goals  which is  like  get stuff done now. So  in a way that kind of put me things  put things in perspective for me. Realize that I shouldn’t be burning too much time messing around. By  I mean  certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because it’s  it’s a good time to have fun and relax. But  at the same time  I shouldn’t do it in excess. So  I guess that’s helped me a little bit. 
p5,6,Interviewer: That makes since. So  uh  uh  think about the job you’d like to have. Might be a rep or something else. Do you have something in mind? ,Interviewee: Um  actually  yeah  um. I’ve never had lab experience before  so I really want a role  which is why-
p5,6,Interviewer: O good  yeah  OK.. So now  why do you think we should give you this job?,Interviewee: Uh  well  for starters  um  I don’t have any experience  so I feel like  um  it’s a good place for me to start. And I’m really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it. Um  I see how  um  I’m not taking too many classes this semester cuz I’m a course advantage. I’ll be making sure I’ll have enough time to make classes  uh  more manageable. I should be able to commit hours on it. I’m really interested in the job I’m doing  so  hopefully that interest will inspire me  uh  inspire me to work hard.
p5,6,Interviewer: Ah  well  thank you for your time. I appreciate you coming in and interviewing today.,
p50,2,Interviewer: Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  well  I was born in Nigeria.  Um  and I moved to the United States at the age of eight  um and lived here  um  in Boston actually ever since.  Um  and um  for as long as I remember umm I've always wanted to go into the medical field. Umm I've always wanted to be a doctor  and just recently actually discovered that I wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and I feel like that was when it clicked that I actually really want to be a pediatrician.  Umm and I've tutored a lot  umm middle school and high school  and that's really like affirmed the fact that I do like my career.  I want it to be something where I work with kids.
p50,3,Interviewer: That's great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: A time I've demonstrated leadership. Umm I guess one obvious one is the student groups that I work with. Umm my primary umm student group is the black students union. I'm currently a coach here. Umm and I've been active with the group since I've been at MIT. Umm currently as a coach here I plan all events for umm the group umm as well as kind of represent the group umm in front of administration as far as like what our members want  what they need  umm if they have any concerns or anything like that. And we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate what's going on  what we're doing  and what our membership needs and what how they can help us with that.
p50,4,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Team...faced a challenge. Umm. Okay  umm I guess back to the student group. Umm so this is the second time I've actually been on the executive board. Umm the first  umm  last year the executive board ran really smoothly. We worked well together but this year we...we're kind of having problems 'cause it's a new set of people so it's kind of hard adjusting umm to the people I'm working with. Umm so you know  we all have different viewpoints  different ways of approaching things. Umm  so we had a lot of loss of communication  which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks we've been able to kind of figure out that  you know  there's been a loss of communication  and we should definitely  like  you know  we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done.
p50,5,Interviewer: Okay. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: My weaknesses...umm. I think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no. I'm the kind of person that  if someone asks me to do something even if I feel like it's impossible I always say yes. Umm and I've always...I think I realized that problem when I came at MIT and I've been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and I'm a junior right now. Umm and what I've been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself. Umm I have my calendar. I live by my calendar  and I know if it doesn't fit on my calendar  if it's overlapping with something  then absolutely no  I can't do it. So I live by my calendar now and it's definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them.
p50,6,Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you? What it is [??] medical school?,Interviewee: [laughs] Umm. I think that I am a good asset. Umm  one  because MIT experience has definitely prepared me for  I would say  the worst  umm because of the experience as an MIT student. So  it's a unique experience  umm but I've also umm gained a lot of umm a broad range of academic skills  umm not just in  in the life sciences but also in engineering field and political science field umm that I think I can bring into the medical field umm with the help of the knowledge that I gain in medical school to kind of help the world  which is want I want to do  ultimately. So I think umm I would be a good asset for the medical field.
p50,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p52,2,Interviewer: So tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Umm so I'm a junior at MIT  i'm a math major  umm i have experience in both the economic side of thing's and uhh cs  simple coding   umm interested in going into probably analytic's or trading in the future.
p52,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Umm so I'm involved in the undergraduate study of Women in Math and one of the most recent activities we've been doing involves kind of an outreach project  umm for middle school and high school girl's where we can bring them together and have them all do a collaborative math event as opposed to normal competition math  so i kind of experimented in the project to umm do that.  It was originally aimed for just  ya know  local umm Boston girl's  so we did all the publicizing for that  I mean I know  get it a lot more publicity than we expected  people in from like California and stuff  so.
p52,3,Interviewer: Oh  wow.,Interviewee: Yup.
p52,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Okay  umm so I guess I'm also a member of China Development Initiative  and so a lot of times  umm  when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that.  But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers. So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers  getting them to really correspond with us.  Like sometimes they'll respond and be like oh  were interested  but then they just don't follow up  so going after them  kinda looking for that response.
p52,5,Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: okay  umm I would say I'm generally more of a passive person  when someone gives me a task I'll do it I won't really  like if i get stuck I'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help.
p52,5,Interviewer: Mhmm.,Interviewee: Umm so I've been trying to umm  i guess talk to more higher ups  if i run into issues  or ask more questions i guess.
p52,6,Interviewer: Great.  Why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Umm we being?
p52,6,Interviewer: This company that does analytic's?,Interviewee: Okay. Umm I think i would bring a lot to the team in terms of  umm  teamwork in addition to the qualifications i have academically speaking  umm  I guess i would say that I have a lot of experience working with teams  umm a lot of experience in the analytic side of thing's as well  umm as well as a pretty interdisciplinary background in general.  So i would be able to bring a lot more  umm  i guess  umm directions to the team.
p53,2,Interviewer: OK. Good. Tell me about yourself. ,Interviewee: Um  well  my name's Ann. I'm currently a Junior in [??] Biology. I'm originally from San Francisco. Um  I am interested in going to medical school. And  I didn't really come to this decision until  like  around Au-  August or September of this year.
p53,2,Interviewer: Oh.,Interviewee: I was deciding  like  I mean  I always had it  like  in the back of my mind . . .
p53,2,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . 'cuz my dad is a doctor.
p53,2,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: Um  but  and I knew coming into college I wanted to study Biology. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do  um  like  research or  um  medical school. So  um  I had a year off  or I still have a year off. And of course [??] and I really liked it. But I felt like research is something  uh  you have to be  like  self driven . . ..
p53,2,Interviewer: Mm.,Interviewee: . . . to do. And  I kept getting  like  frustrated because a lot of my experiments  they wouldn't work  and I felt really bad. [??] And then  uh  I also  like  volunteer at a hospital just to  like  gain experience and see what it's like. And  uh  I enjoy helping people. So  I think  decided for sure now [??] school.
p53,3,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  I guess leadership can be  like  defined in a lot of ways  I guess. One of my main activities that I've been doing at [??] is  um  working in a student group called ESP  or the Educational Studies Program.
p53,3,Interviewer: Oh  OK.,Interviewee: And  um  so I teach an AP biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area. And I guess that's kind of like being a leader because you have to  like  stay in control of the class and organize everything.
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Um  I guess  um  the experience that's  like  most  like  strongest in my mind is actually from high school.
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: So I used to be on  uh  my high school's robotics team. And  uh  none of us really  like  knew much about engineering or  like  building robots when we first started.
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: So it required a lot of  like  teamwork and working together. Um  I remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into sub-teams and then each sub-team would  like  work on a part of the robot. 
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: But then sometimes we forgot to  like  communicate clearly with each other  and then that result in major problems down the road. So . . . 
p53,4,Interviewer: Yeah. How did you resolve that problem?,Interviewee: Um  so I guess for us it was like a spe-  special situation because  um  um  we were all  like  my friends and I  were all sophomores.
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: And then  there were no upperclassmen above us . . .
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . on our robotics team. So  our  like  very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didn't  we had no  like  prior experience . . . 
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm.,Interviewee: . . . in how to organize a team. So  like  after our first year  like  our sophomore year together  we  like  like  had a  like a sit down discussion afterwards . . .  
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm.,Interviewee: . . . and  like  talked about what went wrong  like  what could've been better.
p53,4,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: So the next year we  we have  like  uh  we implemented  like  uh  daily meetings. So  like  before we would  like  split up for the day and  like  work on our  uh  work on our robot. We would  like  outline a plan and then  like  show it to everyone . . . 
p53,4,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . and  like  discuss with everyone. So that really helped. they discuss 
p53,5,Interviewer: Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: Um  one of my weaknesses is I'm really shy. Like  I think when I was younger I go-  I didn't like to  like  talk to strangers . . .
p53,5,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: . . . or talk in  in front of a large group of people. So  um  when I came to college I thought that  uh  I should try to improve that. So  um  I think the main thing I tried to do was the teaching activity I talked about before. Um  requires me to  you know  stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for  like  three hours at a time. So  I think  uh  I'm becoming a lot more comfortable  like  talking in front of people I don't really know that well.
p53,6,Interviewer: Mm-hmm  that's great. Um  why do you think you should get into medical school?,Interviewee: Um  I think I have  like  the passion to help people. Um  I  I had a lot of  like  volunteer activities  but I really enjoy helping people  especially  like  um  children.
p53,6,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: So I used to  I used to tutor  like  young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read. Um  and I'm currently doing the  like  tutoring  I mean  not tutoring  the AP [??] teaching. You know  um  so I'm  like  motivated to help people. Um  and I think that  like  as  especially as the world becomes  like  bigger  or the population gets greater  more and more people  like  will need medical help. So  I think being a doctor would be a good  good way to help people. 
p53,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p55,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?,Interviewee: I'm doing very well  thanks. How are you?
p55,2,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: I'm currently a junior  pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics. A lot of interesting questions come up where it’s a lot of actually thinking innovatively and that’s why I’ve chose to major in both of these and  actually  that’s why I’m interesting in consulting is because it’s a good application of the problem solving that I’m doing in both of those.
p55,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Umm  recently  I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project  however  umm  these was  I noticed a lack of communication  a lack of set deadlines  so  umm  in that case  I kind of stepped up. I organized communication between all of us. I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and  you know  it’s a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline. Umm  I’ve also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured.
p55,3,Interviewer: Yeah  that’d be great.,Interviewee: Okay. Umm  last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that  the biggest event  especially logistically  fell under my responsibilities  so I  with a $2 200 budget  organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston  so this involved  umm  finding places  making all food allergies were taken care of  really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening  and this also involved a lot of delegation because  you know  there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldn’t personally be in charge of all of those  so I had to delegate out to a committee  make sure that they knew what was happening  manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left  who hadn’t gone as yet  everyone knew their reservations  how to get there  how to get back. So  in that case  it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that.
p55,4,Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Umm  let me see. I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we weren’t all on the same page and not communicating.
p55,4,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: Umm  so I guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out. So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution.
p55,5,Interviewer: Great. Tell…Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Yes. Umm  I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything I’m doing  you know  that  like  I’m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh  management really excites me too  I want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when you’re really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but I’m conscious of this year. I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year  while doing all of those  I wasn’t sleeping as much  which  you know  while I was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if you’re tired. So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and I’m aware of that  so when I feel myself reaching my limit  I’ll actually try to prioritize more.
p55,6,Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: As I mentioned before  what I’m studying in school is very applicable to consulting  but  in addition to that  I’m really excited about the work that consultants do  especially  as I mentioned  I’m very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those  delve into them  and in consulting I’d get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both  which is  again  the problem solving  the thinking innovatively. These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do  so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that I’ve spoken to really engaging and it seems  from all of my previous conversations with them  that they’re really excited about this  which is  you know  exactly what I would hope to bring as well.
p56,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Good.
p56,2,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: I'm a junior at MIT studying Ocean Engineering. And I'm really interested in working with big ships. I love being on boats and by the water. I am on the sailing team. I spent the summer building underwater robots.
p56,3,Interviewer: Wow  great! Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  this last year  um  I restarted the section of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers at MIT. We had one about five years ago when Ocean Engineering was Course 13  but now it's merged with the Mechanical Engineering Department and when that happened the organization fell apart. But I knew that me and some of the other Ocean Engineers wanted to really have our own society. So I started it and I went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us.
p56,3,Interviewer: So you basically restarted the whole thing?,Interviewee: Mmhmm
p56,4,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: This last January I was working with my team in robotics team. And we  there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider  which is pretty huge. The parts are so large and so heavy we couldn't machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally. But we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil. Um  so like  but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didn't have all the sensors we needed  but otherwise had the same capabilities. And it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything. And um  it was easier to understand the small piece. But there was an awkward moment in January when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didn't know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one. And so I was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider. So we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider.
p56,5,Interviewer: Great. Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: One of my weaknesses is  I think  being aware of the energy that I bring into a room. So when I am at meetings I really try to put positive energy into the room. Even if one day I'm really feeling quiet I make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things.
p56,6,Interviewer: Great. And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Haha
p56,6,Interviewer: Something along the lines of something relevant to what you'd want to hear.,Interviewee: You should hire me because  um  I can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience  especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles. And I have experience working on teams.
p56,6,Interviewer: Great.,
p57,1,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: Great [laughs] tired.
p57,2,Interviewer: Good  me too. Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  alright  I go to MIT  course ten and seven. Um  I want to be a doctor. I'm an EMT. What else is there? A little sister. Hmm  I grew up here in Florida  but I was born in Toronto. 
p57,2,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: Uh  yeah [laughs]
p57,3,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  probably when I worked as an EMT. You know  you're there to support your colleagues. And  you know  people have to trust you  if there're going to want to call you. And that's the whole of this service  is that we want people to trust us  and  you know  taking on the extra work load and working  'cus I'm an MIT student  and  you know  taking nightshifts or working in between classes and. Pretty great responsibility  so.
p57,4,Interviewer: Tell me about the time you're on a team and faced a challenge. And how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Um  I rode for six years  so  you know  it's obviously a team requirement  so. Basically every time you show up to a race  that's a challenge  right? And  I have a quote that hangs on my wall  and it's training is the opposite of hoping. So  it's just working really hard to  sort of  prepare  for  you know  trying to achieve your goal. Because I think all the training  you know  that's how you make your own fate or  preparing  you know  preparing for a test  whatever.
p57,4,Interviewer: Mm-hm.,Interviewee: And to work for it  you know  things don't come very easy  so.
p57,5,Interviewer: Great. And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: I am a huge perfectionist. So  you know  you [inaudible] into trivial things that  you know  you know  I shouldn't waste so much time perfecting and I- I will  so. That's- that's probably the worst thing. My boyfriend tells me all the time  he's like You have to stop expecting everything to be perfect I'm like I know  so. Uh  just trying to  like  put things in perspective I guess  so.
p57,5,Interviewer: Okay.,Interviewee: Definitely became harder to do at MIT. You know  you can't be perfect because  you know  everyone here essentially is  so. Everyone's very good at doing stuff  so.
p57,6,Interviewer: And why do you think you should get into medical school?,Interviewee: Um  I mean  because I work really hard. I love it. I don't see myself doing anything else with my life. It's weird [inaudible] Why are you doing that?  I don't know you know  I thought it was this thing  but. I don't see myself  you know  sitting in a cubicle or behind a computer being like a code monkey. Um  I need a career  I'm up on my feet and. I love interacting with people. I love the science behind medicine. And  um  you know  being able to change someone's life. I know it's probably a pretty cliched answer  but it's the only thing that like  I can see myself doing. You know  adding productively into society  so.
p58,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing?,Interviewee: I’m doing good. How are you?Thank you. 
p58,2,Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Well  um  my name is Jeff  um. I was born in Japan. I lived there for seven years before I moved to the  uh  US. First  to Michigan for two years and then to Maryland. Um  and it was when I was in high school  or I’m sorry  middle school that I was exposed to um  a lot of different math  uh  science  advanced science courses. Um  it was where  um  I was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions. And  it was around my uh  junior year in high school. It was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures I decided to do pre-med. I decided to pursue  uh  a career in medicine. Um  so it was in high school that I decided start taking biology classes  physics  physiology  and  um  when I got here to MIT I decided to major in Course 20. Um  and  after about four lab positions  two of the (inaudible) and two of chemistry that I realized  um  the Course 20  the medicine track wasn’t for me. Um  mainly because it wasn’t quantitative enough or competitive enough  or fast paced enough for me. But  with my last internship in the biotech industry  I had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors. Um  it was because of and through that meeting I realized that I might really like finance  and that it might be more suitable for me. Um  and afterwards I started talking to some colleagues. Um  some finance majors. And  that’s why I’m here. 
p58,3,Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership. ,Interviewee: Um  I would say it was during high school. There was this one group sophomore year. We had to do this mission  this project called Mission Impossible where we had to design a rover that would uh  traverse  a uh  a uh  platform with quantum data. The problem with the group was there was supposed to be a leader  but nobody really took an responsibility to do what they had to do. That was partly due to the fact that nobody really individuals were assigned anything. So  that was when I had to  I decided to take the initiative a couple of days before it was due. Actually  with the whole project  to uh  become the leader. The unofficial itself leader. As a leader I  uh  assigned a tasks to people. Politely  I asked them to do this because this was a very um (coughs)  multi- prospective project that um. It required programming construction and educating. And  yeah  I decided to be leader and assign tasks. And  I would say it was pretty successful the robot got in time it was due. 
p58,4,Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: Ok  well I would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company. Um  and the problem was that I was working as an individual group. It was because I was working with cells. And  cells  the way cells work  is that um  that you culture them  like on say day 1. And  you let them grow like four or five or six  and then you let them grow until you collect  data. And  the problem is you’re not even can’t collect the data on day one  you have to collect on day six. And  if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five  the data will make no sense. You would have to re-start the experiment. And  I was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project. And  in the first two weeks  I contaminated the cells. Um  both weeks  um. And  so my data had to be re-done  my experiment had to be re-done. The problem was that this was a ten week project and I had eight weeks to do. One thing I learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise. And  uh  what I did was  I went to people for help. Um  and I definitely spent more hours. I talked to the HR department  I talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours. Uh  so instead I went Saturdays and Sundays too. In fact  there was this one point where I worked 23 days in a row  um. And  uh  successfully  I think finished it. In fact  after my data analysis and data compiling  uh  I presented my data to the site director. He told me I had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there. Um  So  Yeah  it was during challenges like that  because of challenges like that that I’ve learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help. 
p58,5,Interviewer: Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it?,Interviewee: I think one of my weaknesses is that I don’t have a formal education in finance. Um  I decided to be Course 20  and um  uh  and I decided to pursue pre-med. And  I was  I agree  uh  that it was a very sudden transition to math Course 18. I think make up for that at least partially by  uh going to workshops  uh going to reading books  um. I definitely have been networking with colleagues. So  in terms of the financial models  uh  the mental math skills and the preliminary skills that I mean to  I believe I have a very strong grasp of those. 
p58,6,Interviewer: Now  why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Well  I think  um  that compared to the rest of the competition  no one shows more initiative than I do. And  in fact  I don’t anyone has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours. Um  I think one of my strengths is that I don’t have any problems with high expectations because I had to do such a sudden transition in career. I had to do a lot research to convince myself that I won’t have to do this transition again. Like I said  I’ve networked  I’ve done tons of research  I’ve read books  I’ve done tons and tons of research. And you know  out to site directors  you know even out to first year analysts. And  I know exactly what my job is. And  I know that the long hours are tough and anyone else who says they like the long hours would be lying to you. And  I know the exact skill sets required  and I believe I have those skill sets. 
p58,6,Interviewer: Well  thank you again for coming.,Interviewee: Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity. 
p58,6,Interviewer: Yes  it was great to meet you.,
p59,2,Interviewer: Gooood  tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So  umm I'm from Chicago... and I'm a junior here at MIT  umm when I came here I was pretty sure I wanted to do health related work  so I guess I came in as a biology major. And my dad is also a MDHP really interested - or really involved in research
p59,2,Interviewer: Mhm.,Interviewee: Um  and so sort of that influenced me a lot. So then I realized  after doing biology for two years essentially  that I wasn't really enjoying it (laughs). And so  I decided to try out computer science. Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future  which it's not that I don't like biology  it's that I didn't feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess. And so  um yeah.
p59,2,Interviewer: Great.,Interviewee: So then I decided to do computer science. That's a very small part of me (laughs). That's a very broad question.
p59,3,Interviewer: So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Um  so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met  and what we do is  we're partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad  so our group is basically non profit. We work with HIV health care work in Togo  and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose  it's been a work in progress  it's the first time I've ever been like in a president's role in a group of about 30 people. And all the records are new this year  its a new organization. So it's sort of like realizing  you know there's so many aspects of leadership  it's not just like  not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show that's being maintained properly. Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group. Um so I guess I've been learning a lot. Do you have specific questions about that?
p59,3,Interviewer: No  I want to hear about your experience.,Interviewee: Okay. So yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know  my age  umm and we're all like new at it  it's definitely a work in progress. But we do a number of things in terms of umm  we fund raise for... so we hold campaigns and we fund raise  in order to basically fund our projects abroad in Togo  so we are trying.. our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that we're partnered with in Togo  so we... it's hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad  it's not like  we haven't met them yet  and it's a new partnership  so we're traveling there this summer but since it's new its kind of as a leader I think it takes a lot of like  not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up. You can't just do everything yourself.
p59,3,Interviewer: Mhm.,Interviewee: Even if that seems easier. Umm and then also like  maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives. So that's the biggest challenge I think  but.
p59,4,Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you're working on a team a face a challenge  how do you solve that problem?,Interviewee: Umm... so I guess the same organization  we had a lot of umm  problems. Um  so  we are a team as an organization. So last year I was like a director on the exec board  but not umm one of the co-presidents  and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated  had very poor communication  and we didn't have  we just didn't really get anything done. Umm so a challenge on my part was not really  I wasn't sure  I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know  motivate our staff  because it's not like  it's not just about us  we obviously  there are people that like depend on us.. and umm  the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time  while trying to.. trying to get them motivated but you know  telling  and I think a challenge was that they felt it was  they felt personally attacked when people criticize them. Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you can't do everything  if that person is the president you just have to let them do what they're gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right  but don't try to push  like you can't always push through things  sometimes you gotta just like go.
p59,4,Interviewer: Mhm.,Interviewee: And like... and I guess that's... that did kind of solve the problem. I mean  I didn't solve the problem of like  things not getting done. But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot. Because it was just like banging your head against the wall. So.. yeah! (Laughs)
p59,5,Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: That's like also a weakness I guess.. I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm.. Knowing how to step back and not umm.. basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort  and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency. So umm... definitely giving people the chance to do the job right. And sometimes you make second chances. So I think that's.. I might have a bad temper sometimes. That can be part of it (laughs). So yeah.
p59,6,Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: I think because I'm very motivated. And I have a lot of self initiative and I'm hard on myself  so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way  and that can  I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about  but I think that is umm good in  when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time. And somebody who really takes like  self responsibility for things. So.. I think if it's for like a project for example  like a small group project its like good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group. And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to  to coordinate the group better. Like vocally. (Laughs)
p6,2,Interviewer:  Tell me about yourself,Interviewee:  I am in aerospace and engineering  and a  
p6,3,Interviewer:  Ready?  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee:  well with ROTC you get a lot of  
p6,4,Interviewer: mm wow ok tell me about a time when working on a team and facing a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: ah in unified last year  uhm we had the  
p6,5,Interviewer: ok and can you tell me one of your weaknesses that hopefully will never come in?,Interviewee: One of my big weaknesses would be ah  
p6,5,Interviewer: and what are you doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: well ROTC is kinda forcing me into  
p6,6,Interviewer: and why do you think we should hire you,Interviewee: (slight laugh)
p6,6,Interviewer: (finishes sentence) in the meaning,Interviewee: ah because I'm physically qualified and  
p6,6,Interviewer: great,Interviewee: Mmm  hmmm
p60,1,Interviewer: Ok. Alright  Ready to go?,Interviewee: I’m good  
p60,2,Interviewer: How are you doing today?,Interviewee: How are you?
p60,2,Interviewer: Good,
p60,2,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself,Interviewee: Umm  So my name is Juliann  ok  uhh  just hold up  so what  what exactly would this interview?
p60,2,Interviewer: You can say background,Interviewee: Ok
p60,2,Interviewer: It’s a behavioral  short behavioral interview for I guess for Med School,Interviewee: Ok  
p60,2,Interviewer: Ok?,Interviewee: So I’m Juliann  I go to MIT  I’m currently a junior  I’m hoping to attend your  the medical school that I’m applying to  
p60,2,Interviewer: Mmm  hmmm,Interviewee: Umm yeah I’m studying computer science and biology  which is a pretty new umm course here at MIT  and currently I’m taking mostly biology classes  I’m also doing research in the hematology lab  and umm  yeah so a little bit about myself umm I guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college  I was born in Tai… I was born in California… in Irvine  umm and my parents and I moved back to Taiwan when I was about 10  so I went to International school there  umm but yeah  most of my friends were pretty bilingual. They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that I’m pretty you know fluent at both languages. And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes.
p60,3,Interviewer: Great  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Ok  umm let’s see… So I as I said I’m from Taiwan and I’m  I’m part of a student group here at MIT  called the association of Taiwanese students  and what I actually was  was a cultural chair uh  for a year  and one of our main events is to create a night market  so umm  yeah  so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia  uhh we actually took it inside into our student center  so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs  so this included like the Chinese students club  umm  the association of  sorry the Asian American Association  as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event  and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food  and what we thought  we thought that this was you know  one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place  so umm  yeah I think that you know ha… getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm  you know time everybody needed to set up  umm and we  yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that  and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something  umm  you know  arise out of that.
p60,4,Interviewer: Great  and tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?,Interviewee: A team  umm  lets see  ok so over the summer umm  I actually  this last summer before my junior year  umm  I went to Taiwan and China. Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach…
p60,4,Interviewer: Mmm hmmm,Interviewee: And this was in groups of three  so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group…
p60,4,Interviewer: Mmm hmmm,Interviewee: And so what this conflict arose  umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we weren’t sure because there were  there was also another group  another group of three teaching at the same time and we weren’t sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more  more time with all of the six instructors  umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks…
p60,4,Interviewer: Mmmm,Interviewee: And so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know  three versus three  like three of us wanted  we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students. And umm  yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated  umm  like so two of uhh  my colleagues  like one person from my team  and someone from the other  umm had you know really strong  strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do. So  you know what I said was  hey  everybody like let’s sit down and calm down  and you know think this through and talk it through  and you know I  I felt like I was one of the mediators in that  you know I didn’t let myself get you know too involved at first  and I didn’t let you know start screaming or anything like that  and I was really the one that said hey everybody sit down  umm  let’s talk this through  and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through  talked it through  and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages? And in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth  Since it was only two weeks anyway  and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the MIT instructors from all different backgrounds.
p60,5,Interviewer: Ok. Ok  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Ok. I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh  self confidence. I  you know  I’m not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything
p60,5,Interviewer: Mmm hmm,Interviewee: Umm  and you know there are people  like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot. And I think that that’s something that I have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well.
p60,6,Interviewer: Great. And why do you think you should get into this medical school?,Interviewee: Well I think that  you know  I (laughs) I I’ve demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field  umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT. 
p60,6,Interviewer: Mmmmm,Interviewee: So that’s been a very  very large  big part of my life since umm last January. Umm  when I got my EMT  EMS umm license  and yeah so I actually work here at MIT umm as a Emergency Medical Technician  Uhh  I work probably 15 hours a week on that. Umm  but moreso beyond my experience I really have a passion for the medical field. Umm  and I you know want to see help both the research that I do that you know  hopefully  in the future uhh  some clinical  the clinical work that I do will effect medical field.
p61,1,Interviewer: So uh  how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Pretty good  how are you?
p61,2,Interviewer: I'm well. Um  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: All right. Um  I guess  to start with the basics  I'm uh  a junior at MIT right now. I'm studying course six three  it's computer science. And uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year. And um  that's after I transferred here from the University of Michigan. And then uh  since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science. 
p61,2,Interviewer: No  awesome. Our courses department is pretty excellent here.,Interviewee: Yeah.
p61,3,Interviewer: So uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: All right  um  so this past um  this past summer um  I uh  got  well I guess last year  I got involved with an organization on campus called Camp Kasim.
p61,3,Interviewer: Uh-hmm.,Interviewee: And so  Camp Kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients. And it's um  it's kind of a therapeutic camp  so the aim is for kids to just have fun. And  anyway  we have various units that we break the kids up into to  that are divided up by age. And um  I wasn't the unit leader for my unit but uh  there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh  it was either his break or he had to uh  go off and take care of some other stuff. And so  uh  I was kind of given control of the unit. And so um  it was an interesting experience  because we were dealing with kids. But um  obviously the counselors were adults and college students  my peers.
p61,4,Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah  I think so  it's always import to help the problem. Uh  so tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome the problem?,Interviewee: All right um  so in  I guess  the last time I can really remember being part of uh  really intense team experience was um  in high school  I was on the year book as a photographer. So um  we  I  my friend and I were both the head photographers. So we  organized all the photos. And so  we would coordinate with the editors. And um  in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed  like what events needed to have photos taken of them  or what teams needed photos. And  we would go about organizing the actual um  like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos. And  so um  there we times when  like just getting  making sure that our photographers got to events uh  and like  and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um  was  could be very challenging. Because  I mean  because we were all very busy students. And so um  one  like just  I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like  really commit to their job and follow through on that. And so  part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like  team culture. And  a sense of like  comradery among the photographers themselves. 
p61,4,Interviewer: Ah  yes. ,Interviewee: Um  you know  try to get people to um  like try to get people to go to event  even though  and they weren't assigned. Just out of  like the eagerness to take photos and photography. And so  um  we kind of approached this challenge and motivated  it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our  our um  peers. And so  um  or like incentivizing these photos. And  we approached by trying to  like build a sense of community and uh  like  like  and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos. Um  it was  it ended up playing out very well  but there's still a couple photographers who just  you know. 
p61,4,Interviewer: Yeah. ,Interviewee: They just didn't want to do the job  sometimes. I mean  they  they usually had like  valid  some what valid excuses  but. 
p61,4,Interviewer: That inevitable. ,Interviewee: Yeah  but yeah this job still need to get done. So uh  yeah  I mean  that was uh  pretty interesting team experience. 
p61,5,Interviewer: That went well. So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?,Interviewee: Sure  um  yes. Let's see  um  maybe one of my  I'd say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly. Uh  at times I struggle to uh  I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what I'm thinking. And so  I like  I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence. And um  there's some situations were  just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh  can be problematic. And in other  in other situations  like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful  because I've  you know  I don't say anything  I don't tend to say anything rash. And so  um  it has it's merits. But usually  its just in general  it's nicer just to have a faster pace so  in kind of like conveying thoughts. 
p61,6,Interviewer: So  now thinking back to the job that we talked about  now why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Um  um  so I'd say that I'm committed  hard working  uh  person. And  in terms of this job I guess  uh  and my edge  can I describe what it is?
p61,6,Interviewer: Sure.,Interviewee: All right  so in my head it's a software engineering position and so  I believe as um  I can contribute a lot to this  with the skills that I've gained here at uh  MIT. And  then also  I believe that I can gain a lot from the company  in terms of learning um  about what they do and how they do it. And  I think it would be a good partnership. 
p61,6,Interviewer: Well  thank you. For coming to your interview today.,
p61,,,
p62,2,Interviewer: Please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: So  umm I was wandering  umm I'm actually from Russia. I grew up in Tulun  though  and I normally go to Cambridge University-
p62,2,Interviewer: Really?,Interviewee: -which is  which is where I study. Here I am  uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with MIT. Uhh I study course six umm mainly I focus my interest  split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where I focus more on devices look like  nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh I think it has to do with AI control machine loading umm so what I'm interested in. I've been taking courses to that uhh goal  so things like 6034  6052  6017  umm in those same areas I've done several projects umm like something Cambridge over summer  I did a I wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on Mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics  planetary rotation umm and I have to write an AI which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft. Umm similarly  I've also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in Cambridge. Umm it was similar to MIT's Mass Lab umm and I was on the software team again uhh although I have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to  in a team of six  create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box  and I programmed the uh AI for that. So that's the most experience I've had. Umm in Cambridge here uhh I've considered participating in uhh umm Battlecode or Mass Lab perhaps. Umm there's been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class; those should be quite interesting. 
p62,2,Interviewer: Excellent. That was  that was a wonderful experience.,Interviewee: Yeah  yeah it was good  pretty good.
p62,3,Interviewer: So umm tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership?,Interviewee: Umm  so umm again  in the robotics project uhh competition at Cambridge umm in in our team of six I had to  in some ways  help out and direct the design choices in our  umm  for the competition. Uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because I am running the AI  I have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do  what its components are and I was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that. And I made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was  the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems  stuff doesn't work  breaks  umm so yeah. And I also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and I had to blast them on umm well what I wanted to be done for the AI to work properly. Umm another case of leadership  I guess  was I did military service in Finland uh uhh as a citizen-
p62,3,Interviewer: Yeah.,Interviewee: -and  umm  so we had this  at the end of the service near to the end  there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad  umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things  umm I really didn't know what he was doing  but I-I had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that  you know  these two guys  you know  do this cable and these guys set up the radio  I'll do this and so yeah it was quite alright I guess that way.
p62,4,Interviewer: Hmm. Uhh that's all the license. Umm so I guess we can go over some of the details. Can you tell me a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?,Interviewee: Umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams  three sub teams. One was mechanical  one was electrical  and one was uhh AI. Now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team  umm we said that it'd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics 'cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the AI is easily written by me  when umm I just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people  it was rather simple AI I guess. Umm now  with the mechanics it's much more important they get all this stuff done  leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team  more man power to the mechanical team. Uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics 'cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts 'cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a CPU inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits. Umm so one of the guys  Oscar  umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh Calvin did much more the soldering and stuff. I kind of helped out when they needed some help. Umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done we'd be able to produce a kind of working-ish result-
p62,4,Interviewer: Ahh.,Interviewee: -so that we could get stuff out. So as an example  I-I made a control system which uhh follows the lines way before I wrote any of the code for picking up stuff or testing what it is and how to choose where it goes. The idea was that I am able to follow the line and turn umm which kind of tricky actually  so the way the sensors set up and the motors weren't properly balanced and such. Umm so the mechanic guys managed to work together umm at a quick rate with just some of the basic plates they didn't they didn't cut them or anything. They just got a plate  put some motors on  uhh hooked up the motors into the CPU  and did that and it worked. I was able to make the AI which follows the lines which was pretty good. Umm also that that that did mean that the umm the Oscar who made the sensor connectors umm he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits work before he made any other control circuits. But delegating those things that way it  well will do a step by step  and do it gradually.
p62,5,Interviewer: Umm so tell me what are your weaknesses and you're going about to improving them.,Interviewee: Umm I guess one of my weaknesses is that I often get carried away umm I guess somewhat arrogantly. Umm when I'm working with something  and I think I have a really good idea of what I am doing  umm something is better than other umm I have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe they're doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more self-absorbed in what resources need to be allocated because I'm doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so I can use this for longer or something. Umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing  I guess. Umm I'm trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though I think I have an idea of what I'm doing  I don't actually or that I might be mistaken. So I kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah  but it's a work in progress.
p62,6,Interviewer: Umm so now finally  think of the job you'd like to have. So now why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Umm well you should hire me because I am capable of uhh pretty good verbal communication umm I don't really stress out much  I think  so I'm quite relaxed that way. I'm able to speak three languages  so I'm able to communicate quite well  umm Norwich  Finnish  and English. Umm and I tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so I'd be good for like a project lead  I guess because I have a pretty good technical background and I understand the tech and I quite enjoy working with the tech and I also like being with a team environment where I can delegate tasks and work on umm different things. On on some things we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project working on a team is quite fun if it works out right.
p62,6,Interviewer: Well thank you for coming.,
p63,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?,Interviewee: Yeah  pretty good. Um  don't feel particularly different from any other day.
p63,2,Interviewer: [laughs] Uh  so  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Um  so I'm from Nearbell Fosten [SP]  Northern Ireland. I have three younger brothers  um  so  I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them. Like  Mark  the next one down  he's only a year younger than me  so he was always a lot sportier. Uh  coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that  I got into those sports. Um  and then Ian  the next one down after him  is a lot more artsy and stuff  so I think because of his influence I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of  like  disregarded before. Um  Like  um  when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like  um  the Scream by Munch or Moonch . . .
p63,2,Interviewer: Yeah.,Interviewee: . . . whatever  which was there  and some Van Gogh Starry Night and some lilies by Monet. So I [??] with that. But you know what? He will probably want to hear about this so I'll go and I'll take some photos for him. Um  and then Harry is the youngest one  he's kind of like just gets away with everything  being the youngest. But  um  should be pretty good to go back around Christmas and catch it with them and stuff. Um  probably not get back over to Cambridge in the UK over Christmas break but I try to keep in contact with friends from there  through like Facebook and stuff. Um  and yeah  just really enjoying my time here at the moment. That's a little bit of background on me and my family. 
p63,3,Interviewer: Uh  excellent. So tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uh  so  this  I'm here on my third year  what you call junior year  my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college. So as part of that we do have like  we call it Thrashers Week  where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush  dorm exploration or whatever  um  so we had a big kind of end to that week  finale event that kind of took over college  like  multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18  so everyone at university could drink  so there were different promotions on different  um  bars all over the place in the college  different attractions and stuff. So  um  just kind of planning that  deciding what the theme would be  um  how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that  and getting music acts  um  getting promotions on the main bar  and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters  fire extinguisher points  emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections  particularly  [??] being responsible for a particular area  I think that's quite a practical hands-on  time when I've been given leadership and I think I done well with it. 
p63,3,Interviewer: Uh  excellent. Sounds like a fun time. ,Interviewee: It was  yeah.
p63,4,Interviewer: So  uh  tell me about a time you worked in a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?,Interviewee: Right. So  um  again going thinking back to Cambridge in the UK  um  we  one of the things that Cambridge is known quite well for is Rowing  so I got to Cambridge and I was like  ah  I've never tried rowing before  I'll take this up. So  um  in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year  but one of friends then decided he didn't have time for it and just kin- kinda dropped it to the wayside  but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there  they're called the Maybumps [SP]. And obviously any kind of sport team work is important  but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other  working as one  and it takes like the whole year to build up this. So him deciding to [??]  was really going to be massively detrimental  'cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but it's not the same. Um  so  convincing him to stay on  as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good  like  boat spirit  that we weren't just here guys that kind of rowed  but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other. And because I had been given responsibility as Boat Captain  no like the overall boat club captain  but that boat. So  um  doing things like havin'  um  pre-race meetings together  and watching  like  video clips before  like kind of motivation Rocky style stuff. Um  and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between  yeah we need to train at this level to be good  but we don't need to go absolutely overboard  and we can gauge when people just need time off  or need time to unwind or de-stress. Um  so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual Bumps races  he hadn't quit and um  we managed to do a lot better than the previous term  previous term being a bit of a disaster  then this term we actually the best boat from the college. So that was pretty satisfying. Um  like  again it just kind of shows  like  the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them  you feel good after. So that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork.    
p63,5,Interviewer: So  tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them. ,Interviewee: Um  I think overall I'm quite  like  confident and happy to talk to people and stuff  but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes I do dive into things a little too eagerly  like  um  it could almost be that I could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the  that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 20-30 seconds  think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it  rather than thinking  okay  they've stopped talking  I better start  and just diving in with an answer. And I'm coming across then as  perhaps  a bit frantic or not completely focused. So I think some of that is just going to be practice   like do interviews  get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while I compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as I've kind of been doing  I think  so far.  
p63,6,Interviewer: [laugh] Um  Actually you've done surprisingly good so far. Uh  so now think of a job that you'd like to have. So why do you think we should hire you?,Interviewee: Um  I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job  but  like  almost any job  um  in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector. It's going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that  like  I've used my university time so far in the UK and in America  really broadening the experience that I've got. Uh  broadening my  uh  ex- exposure to different fields of engineering.
p63,6,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even  like  artsy stuff. Um  I also think that through like projects  lab work  and things of that nature  I have the skills to work in a team. Be that  having the  uh  kind of humility to accept  okay  there's someone more experiences  more knowledgeable than me in this  I'll take the lead from them or I'll start realizing when it's an appropriate time I'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to  or I'm the best qualified to really take command.  
p63,6,Interviewer: Mm-hmm.,Interviewee: So  like  in terms of working with others  that's a strength that I have  um  and I think in terms of contributing to like  the overall atmosphere in the company  I'm quite a pleasant  optimistic person. I like to think that I'm someone that others would be happy to work around  so not only would I be working well  but others would be working well  um  through my being there. Um  I'm not saying like I'm going to suddenly make the company  like  200% more profitable  but I do think that I'll feedback in as much benefit as I'll get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy.
p63,6,Interviewer: Well thanks for coming today.,Interviewee: OK. Thank you.
p64,1,Interviewer: So how are you?,Interviewee: I'm doing pretty good
p64,1,Interviewer: Oh good.,Interviewee: How about you?
p64,1,Interviewer: I'm pretty well.,Interviewee: Yeah  it's kinda shitty outside haha.
p64,1,Interviewer: Well  I brought an umbrella so it's not too bad ,Interviewee: Gotcha. Yeah I thought it was going to snow but I'll take like drizzle over that.
p64,2,Interviewer: Yeah. So uhm... Tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Uhm.. So I'm a junior obviously here at MIT. I'm studying chemical  biological engineering and minoring in economics. Uhm  I live in Cap Sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus. I'm from Chicago. Uhm  actually I was just home recently for Thanksgiving. Uhm  and then  here on campus I obviously go to class and when I'm not in class I do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as  uhm  I try to help with Habitat for Humanity so I do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well.
p64,2,Interviewer: Oh cool. I'm from Chicago too.,Interviewee: Oh cool. Where?
p64,2,Interviewer: Uh  Wilmeka.,Interviewee: Okay  I'm from Siokee.
p64,3,Interviewer: Oh cool. So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.,Interviewee: Uhm  so  if I had to give I guess an example of leadership..uhm.. recently this semester I'd probably talk about uhm working with Habitat for Humanity like I mentioned before  uhm  I'm currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here  both on and off campus  uhm  related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we  uhm  have what we call the Beaverdash. And its a 5k run around the West end of campus.
p64,3,Interviewer: Uh huh,Interviewee: And we've done it about 5 of them now. So this year has since I was in charge of the club I had to organize it  uhm  and it was kind of a unique situation because uhm...
p64,3,Interviewer: Hm.,Interviewee: We were working with the President's office. Uh combining with President Griphes inauguration night. Actually they contacted me
p64,3,Interviewer: Oh wow.,Interviewee: Uh  which was awesome because  like  they have a ton of money
p64,3,Interviewer: *laughs*,Interviewee: And resources that I normally wouldn't have. So I uh was able to work with that. but I think it was a very interesting leadership posi- uh  position because I was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that I work with. As well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate. But then also in conjunction with the President's office which is a couple people in uh staff  uhm. With like  uh  the Z center and things like that. So we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend. So it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of MIT. And like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done. And selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that. So I think it was a really good leadership opportunity and I worked with a lot of interesting people.
p64,4,Interviewer: Ah excellent. So tell me about a time you were working on a team. You faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?,Interviewee: Uhm  lets think of a good challenge. Uhm.. Okay so  uhm  more recently  I was working on well I'm involved with my fraternity. One of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have  like going camping.
p64,4,Interviewer: Uh huh.,Interviewee: So as part of that I work with a team of people  some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for. Some of the are my friend  well everyone's my friend  but so its like an interesting dynamic because you're working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that. So that was like challenge number one. But then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere. The real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that. So I was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people. So we could get a feel for like who was actually coming. Because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up. Those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting. and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain. Traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here we've been really utilizing  uhm  actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals  and then  like  doing allocation of like  who  was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that. Uhm so there's a lot of different allocation of  uh  tasks  and then  like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges.
p64,5,Interviewer: Ah excellent. So  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it.,Interviewee: Yeah. So  uhm  my greatest weakness currently  uhm  the best way I guess to phrase it would be
p64,5,Interviewer: Uh huh.,Interviewee: I guess I feel like I need to be very involved in things I do whether they be like if I'm doing a project or leading an activity I feel like I need to be very on top of whats going on - which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening. But I think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because I've taken too much on for myself. So that's obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what I've kinda been currently doing to counter it.. is uhm  really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what I'm doing especially if I'm involved in. Very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself.
p64,6,Interviewer: Hm  oh that makes a lot of sense. So  I'd like you to think of a job that you'd like to have.,Interviewee: Okay.
p64,6,Interviewer: Got it?,Interviewee: Uhhhmmm  sure.
p64,6,Interviewer: Okay  so  why do you think we should hire you for this job?,Interviewee: Uhm  so I think I bring a lot to the table by having been here for 2 and a half years here at MIT. I've gained a lot of technical skills  of course  I've taken a lot of classes and done a lot of laboratory research. I've done a lot of projects through those classes. And so I think I have a lot of technical skills and  uhm  I  in this position at this company would really have the ability to take these skills and combine them and applying them with the other skills I've picked up here which are leadership and communication skills. Uhm  cause right now they've kinda been in separate realms where I do a lot of activities on campus where I've had the opportunity to plan events and I've kinda been able to take those skills and apply them towards like a technical related problem on which I would be able to do at this company and hone both of those together which I think would be very advantageous for me and very advantageous for you as a company  Uhm  and really allow me to show off the abilities I've learned here.
p64,6,Interviewer: Ah  well  thank you for coming.,Interviewee: Yeah  of course.
p65,1,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?,Interviewee: I’m actually doing pretty well. I’m just  uh  I would say  well  let’s see. It’s the end of the semester  right after Thanksgiving break. So  I have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing. This is the first time I didn’t get home though.
p65,1,Interviewer: Really?,Interviewee: Um  so I spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity. And  we had Thanksgiving dinner together. The turkey  the whole shebang. Um  most people around this time have all sort of exams  that sort of thing. But  all things considered compared to like freshman  sophomore  junior year  um I’m actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior.
p65,1,Interviewer: Oh  ok.,Interviewee: Um  it’s pretty relaxed. Things are good.
p65,2,Interviewer: Ok  please tell me about yourself.,Interviewee: Well  to start  um  I guess to start. The three things I’m doing right now: I’m president of my fraternity  SAE  which I also helped start up.
p65,2,Interviewer: Oh  yeah?,Interviewee: It’s just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere. We were back on campus awhile ago  but that’s history  um. I’m a late grower  and I’m also a chemical engineer. Most people have to say Course 10 for their major that sort of thing  uh. And  I’m part of the growing engineer leadership program. So  uh  all things considered  I would say that the the things that I’ve come to learn the most since coming to MIT are leadership skills  being confident  being able to go in front of people  and  uh  sort of create a vision. Helping people follow that vision. I have had issues in the past of time management. But  I spent a long time doing  like freshman  sophomore year learning the importance of sleep. Bunch of things like that. I’ve gone through the whole  all the trials and tribulations. But  all things considered  I’d say pretty much right now  I’m smooth  like in a groove  doing my own kind of thing. Things that I want to do. And  having a good time. 
p65,3,Interviewer: So  um  back to leadership. Tell me a time when you acted as a leader. ,Interviewee: Well  just like this whole semester. Um  since I’ve been like the president of my fraternity there have been situations with people who are called brothers. Where  they  for some reason  they have these issues that they can’t talk about. I’m the kind of person that I can tell when someone is having. I sort of like pry  not pry  but press a little bit until they either like to decided to like tell me more or tell me what’s going on. There was one case  in the sense that mattered  but there was a person that  um  that became a pledge of our fraternity  he came from the previous president. It’s called rush (talking over each other). Basically  what happened is this guy came in  and very few people knew him when he came in  but once they got to know him over the summer they didn’t like him at all. So  I had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what to do. Like  do we let him stay? Or let him go through the program and see if he improves? Or do we sort of like nip it in the bud right there? Uh  it brought  first off  I didn’t even want to bring that information up until I’d talked to a bunch of people. So  I talked to a bunch of people individually  got a feel for it. Then  I sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go. Ultimately  what ended up happening  was uh  We had to find a really nice way of letting the guy go. It was sort of touchy feely sensitive stuff. I really had to let  to make sure I talked to everyone before that happened. 
p65,4,Interviewer: That’s an excellent example of leadership. So  this is a similar question  but related. Tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. Not this time  a different one. ,Interviewee: Course 10. Chemical engineering. ICE. You are given a challenge in a team. Most people  you can actually choose your team. Most people throughout there are  there fun people  good at working with (inaudible) that sort of thing. Uh  but by the time I went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up. So  I was working with kind of a random group of people. Which kind of worked out. It turned out pretty well. The project itself. You have to design a chemical engineering plant. So  you have to do the reactors  you have to do the flow  the mass flow  the distribution com center  etc. And then there’s a big report. There’s all sorts of stuff. In general breakdown  there’s one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program  the Aspen program. And  then there’s another person whose more like working on the actual write up  and then there’s another person that sort of integrates the two. What  what as the question? Working in a team?
p65,4,Interviewer: Faced a challenge  how did you solve it?,Interviewee: Ok  um  I guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline. Two and three days before the actual deadline  the final project was due  the main issue came up  the kiln wasn’t working  the project wasn’t working. So  it’s a pretty typical MIT scenario. The main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy. So  he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work  when you’re trying to integrate it into the rest of the project  um  we should have collaborating a lot  but this other guy was sort of off in his own world. So  when we needed his part of the project  it was sort of difficult to do. So  what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left. To  sort of get the project together. Um  and I would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet. He did get a lot of quality work done  but looking back  what I would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person  and really tried to get him to be more  uh  evocative. You know  sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed. The project we ended up delivering on time up to spec  but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning.
p65,4,Interviewer:,Interviewee: Yeah. 
p65,5,Interviewer: That makes a lot of sense. So  tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you’ve done to overcome them. ,Interviewee: At the end of every single  like group that I’m with  everyone gets to the sort of critique phase where they see what they’ve done well and what they haven’t done as well. I can sort of like come of as being a little bit  well  gregarious is one thing. Um  but also sometimes I can sort of dominate a conversation. Um  so that’s one thing I learned from the Growing Engineer leadership program. And  the identify each of your skills  and find out that you’re bad at it. And  the thing that I’m really trying to work on is not dominating the conversation. I’ve been working on it over the years. And  the main ways I try to do that  is first off  don’t be the guy who always takes the leadership role right from the get go. What I do is instead if there's a little bit of  if some one is having a hard time  I’ll start giving suggestions. And then people can start jumping on to those suggestions. And  if I notice there is a person who is really good at  like engaged  who really wants to take this forward. I’ll find a way to make it so they become the leader. And  so instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing  I really ask for everyones input. And make it so everyone feels involved. So  this is more of not a one example  but a change that’s in progress. I think  how I was at the beginning  just sort of loud mouth asking a lot of questions  like sort of this is how we are going to do everything. Now  it’s like I volley around ideas and try to get other peoples input instead. 
p65,5,Interviewer: That makes a lot of sense. So  think about a job you would like to have. Do you have one in mind?,Interviewee: Yeah  I’ve been thinking about that for awhile.
p65,6,Interviewer: So  tell me why do you think you should have this job?,Interviewee: Well  the thing about consulting  is that the main reason why it’s intriguing me right now is because it’s the kind of job where everything is fast paced. But  two it’s the critical factor is teamwork. Working with other people who are a variety of ages. Being able to extract information and essentially be able to do a project that has a very short timeline. It has a timeline  it has a scope  got a budget. Being able to do find different resources  make connections  and building relationships with new people. Which I think is one of the most important things  building relationships with people is critical. And then being able to sort of patent those new projects while also being  find out  or getting a breadth  or a feel for so many different fields. I thought about semi-conductors and decide to not do semi-conductors because of the class I’m taking right now. I think team work is the most critical part of the matter. 
p65,6,Interviewer: I think your personality matches that. Well  this concludes the formal part of the interview.,
